-As many of you know Steven Edwards has been a member of both the Wine and ReactOS communities for quiet a while now.  He writes in with his thoughts on the Wine 1.0 process most of which are very valid points worth reading.  Towards the end he also mentions a new Free Software company, Bordeaux, that he has begun which combines technologies from Wine, ReactOS, IES4Linux, Winetricks and others.
