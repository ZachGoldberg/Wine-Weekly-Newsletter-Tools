+<issue num="341" date="2/24/2008" />
+<intro> <p>This is the 341 issue of the Wine Weekly News publication.
+Its main goal is to bring that warm fuzzy feeling that you get when you look at a baby puppy with those big, beady eyes to all it's readers. It also serves to inform you of what's going on around Wine. Wine is an open source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.  Think of it as a Windows compatibility layer.  Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely alternative implementation consisting of 100% Microsoft-free code, but it can optionally use native system DLLs if they are available.   You can find more info at <a href="http://www.winehq.org">www.winehq.org</a></p> </intro>

+WWN has been delayed these past few weeks for several reasons, hopefully all of which have been cleared up and WWNs should flow once a week.  There may be some lapses where there's only one issue for a period of two weeks, but I will do my best to be weekly.
+</p>
+<p>
+Also, I've heard that some people have not found my weekly 'purpose of this weeks WWN' exciting enough (in the opening summary).  I'll do my best to kick those up a notch :).
+</p>
+<p>
+<b> Important: </b> the AppDB stats at the end of this issue take into account the entire month since the last WWN, hence their (huge) size.  The Bugzilla stats also are since the last issue.</p></section>

+<topic>Supporting Wine</topic>
+<p>As you may know by now, Google supports the development of Wine by contributing patches.  They do this not only because they love being the big, squishy, teddy bear of open source love, but also because it helps them run applications like Picasa cross platform.  Dan Kegel summarizes Google's support for wine in the year 2007:
+</p>
+<quote>
+<p>
+Google uses Wine primarily as the basis for the Linux
+port of our photo management software, Picasa. [...]
+Codeweavers did the initial port, and Googlers
+Lei Zhang, Nigel Liang, and Michael Moss are
+improving Wine further for Picasa 2.7.
+</p>
+<p>
+Beyond Picasa, a few of us (Lei Zhang, Alex Balut, and I)
+have been fixing random Wine bugs in our 20% time.
+I've also been doing regular Valgrind runs over the Wine test suite,
+pestering developers who accidentally check in code that Valgrind
+doesn't like.
+</p><p>
+Google also sponsored some work by Codeweavers to improve
+support for Photoshop ('cause so many people want it) and
+for Dragon Naturally Speaking ('cause even Linux users get RSI).
+While not yet perfect, those apps are a lot more usable now
+as a result.  In particular, Photoshop CS and CS2 are quite usable
+indeed.  (See http://wiki.winehq.org/AdobePhotoshop for
+details.)
+</p><p>
+I also had the pleasure of hosting eight students as
+Google interns working on Wine throughout the year.
+Here are their names, and roughly what they worked on:
+Dan Hipschman: widl
+Evan Stade: gdiplus, Powerpoint Viewer
+James Hawkins: msi
+Jennifer Lai: win16 conformance tests
+Juan Lang: crypt32, iTunes
+Matt Jones: mono testing
+Mikolaj Zalewski: Photoshop, Limux
+Roy Shea: svchost, BITS
+</p><p>
+So, you're wondering, what exactly does that all boil down to?
+I tallied all our accepted patches recently; the list is now up
+(along with the exact Wine source we use for Picasa) at
+  http://code.google.com/opensource/wine.html
+I was pleasantly surprised at the size of the list.
+</p><p>
+Separately, Google also sponsored nine Summer of Code
+students this year.  Just to name two who remain active even
+after the end of summer:
+Alex Sørnes, who improved Wine's Wordpad, and
+Maarten Lankhorst, who solved tons of sound problems.
+(And oh, how nice it is to not have to change sound settings anymore!)
+</p><p>
+All that may sound like a lot, and perhaps it is, but it pales
+compared to the work put in on Wine by the rest of the Wine developers.
+Thanks, everybody!  I'm really looking forward to Wine 1.0
+(which, according to Alexandre, is planned for sometime in 2008).
+

+Software Engineer

+</quote>
+
+<p>Interestingly, there are 1905 patches in that list which spans a period of about 2 years.  If we assume there are 250 business days a year, that's 500 business days.  That results in about 4 patches a day, or a patch every 2 hours!</p>

+<topic>Tests</topic>
+<p>
+A lot of developments have been made on the war against test failures on Wine.  The current status is visible <a href="http://test.winehq.org/data/">here</a>.</p>
+<p>
+Dan Kegel pushed the big red button back in the beginning of February to initiate the series of patches to begin fixing all test suite failures:
+</p>
+<quote>
+<p>
+Great progress was made at Wineconf last year on
+getting our test suite closer to always passing on wine, but
+http://test.winehq.org/data/200801301937/#Wine shows
+that, according to the results collected from people who run
+programs/winetest on Wine, twelve DLLs' tests are currently failing.
+(Let alone the test failures on Windows!)
+http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9916 also
+talks about the fact that "make test" shows failures.
+</p><p>
+This situation greatly confuses new developers,
+who assume that any test failure is somehow their
+fault.  And that's a reasonable assumption, let's make it so!
+It would make validating a new Wine development
+environment easy -- it'd be great to be able to say
+ If it doesn't pass "make test" with no errors, something's
+ wrong with the build environment.
+</p><p>
+What's the best way to encourage people to fix these problems?
+Should we designate some upcoming day, week, or month
+as a conformance test bug squishing party?
+Should we offer prizes (or at least notoriety) for
+the person who does the best job fixing
+conformance test suite bugs (as judged by Alexandre
+or his designate)?
+Or is a simple call to arms enough?
+</p>
+</quote>
+<p>
+Jeremy White went back and attempted to build his own winetest executable and export his results.  Apparently winetest was not well documented, and Jeremy had a bit of trouble:
+</p>
+<quote>
+<p>
+Okay, so I boldly tried to use winetest with what documentation
+I could find, and had an...um...interesting time.
+</p>
+<p>
+...
+</p>
+<p>
+It ran, did it's thing, and had one interactive thing
+(Gecko fussed at me; that's not a Winetest bug afaik).
+</p>
+<p>
+Then when it was all done, it transferred my nearly
+1 MB file, and then errored out with:
+ "Unknown build id"
+
+So then I looked at the output file, and sure enough, it had
+a - for build info, not my fancy git id.
+
+So I hacked that, put in jwtip, and then ran winetest -s
+to send my output file through.
+
+And then I have a lovely result here:
+ http://test.winehq.org/data/jwtip/
+
+So that's *something* at least.  Although I suspect someone will now
+have to go clean up my mess :-/.
+
+Cheers,
+
+Jeremy
+</p>
+</quote>
+<p>
+Reece Dunn also had some experience with winetest:
+</p>
+<quote>
+<p>
+The easiest thing I found for generating test results on Wine is to
+treat it like Windows. That is, download the
+winetest-[buildid]-paul-mingw.exe from the build you want to test and
+run:
+<br /><br />
+  wine winetest-[buildid]-paul-mingw.exe
+<br /><br />
+e.g. on the <a href="http://test.winehq.org/data/200801301937/">http://test.winehq.org/data/200801301937/</a> page, the "Main
+summary for build 200801301937", and downloaded
+<a href="http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/users/paulm/WRT/CrossBuilt/winetest-200801301937-paul-mingw.exe">http://www.astro.gla.ac.uk/users/paulm/WRT/CrossBuilt/winetest-200801301937-paul-mingw.exe</a>.
+Then, I ran
+<br /><br />
+   ./wine winetest-200801301937-paul-mingw.exe
+<br /><br />
+from a build of wine-0.9.54 and followed the instructions on the
+program. It did generate an error about not being able to clean the
+log at the end, but it generated the "XP wine-0.9.54-notheme" and "XP
+wine-0.9.54" results without any issues.
+<br /><br />
+I have added my experiences to the wiki
+(http://wiki.winehq.org/ConformanceTests) with a link on the main
+page.
+<br /><br />
+Feel free to update it with your own experiences
+</p>
+</quote>
+<p>
+Maarten Lankhorst also is seeming to have some good results:
+</p>
+<quote>
+<p>
+Hi all,
+<br /><br />
+I'm very close to passing the whole wine conformance suite on my pc.

+<topic>Wine Forums</topic>
+<p>
+The age old topic of how to best maintain communication between a community of developers and the community of users using their product has been brought up again recently.  The key question this time is "should there be an official Wine forum?"  Of course, there are many pros and cons, some people love forums, some hate them, and of course the issue that there already exists a fairly active Wine-users mailing list.  In coming up with a solution, the Wine team wanted to minimize the confusion of having too many different non-centralized and disjoint sources of help.  There already is the Ubuntu Wine forum, independent Wine forums, IRC, and the mailing list, so adding another official channel for communication seemed like the wrong thing to do.</p>
+<p>
+In steps Jeremy Newman with an idea.  Jeremy set up a <a href="http://forum.winehq.org/">new phpBB</a> on <a href="http://winehq.org">winehq.org</a> which is linked directly to the wine-users mailing list.  This results in the best of both worlds: helping those who really like forums and those who really like mailing lists, while keeping both essentially the same source of information.</p>
+<p>
+The only issue is that phpBB, in all its ubiquity, has become a large target for spammers.  Within hours the forum and the users-list were under siege.  After a long weekend of fighting and implementing new techniques, Jeremy Newman has hopefully come out on top.</p>
+<quote>
+<p>
+Yeah, it has been difficult. Since I've never run a PHPbb board before,
+I never know how well these bots had the registration system down. It
+has really raised my blood pressure a bit this weekend.
+</p><p>
+I think I've come up with a solution that will work for everybody.
+First, I updated the "captcha" image validation to be more random and
+harder to screen scrape.
+</p><p>
+Second, I added a text validation field that asks you: "Who is the
+current maintainer of the Wine project?"
+</p><p>
+This should stop both bots and human spammers that don't know about our
+forum.
+</p><p>
+To be nice, I at least added a hint link, that takes you to the "About
+Wine" page on WineHQ, so new users will at least have to read a little
+bit of our history if they don't know.

+v7.6 basically works if you set windows version to windows vista, and

+registry stuff properly.
+</p><p>
+I submitted 8 or so stub dll's to wine-patches that make iTunes v7.6
+actually start after installation. It checks for the dll's and
+silently fails if they don't exist.
+</p><p>
+I haven't done any further testing yet though, but it looks like it is
+probably a small installer bug that prevents itunes v7.6 from
+installing without first manually creating those registry keys.
+</p></quote>
+<p>
+So iTunes needs a (lot) of work to be up and running fully.  However, the point was brought up that for a lot of iTunes functionality, there exists viable Linux-native alternatives.  iTunes would, however, provide syncing etc. which for many would be very useful.  Overall, it was decided that the discussion of whether or not it's "worth it" to work on an application because of alternatives is pretty moot.

+Now that Adobe Photoshop CS2 is running kind of
+well (there are bugs that need fixing, but I'm trying
+to look ahead a bit), what big app(s) are worth focusing on next?
+</p><p>
+Using http://wiki.winehq.org/LinuxApplicatonRequestSurvey,
+skipping Photoshop (which we should continue to fix up)
+and the ones that are either too hard, have native versions,
+or are probably something Codeweavers might already be
+doing, and adding in good old Framemaker (so close to working
+we might want to go for it just for the goodwill from all
+those tech writers),  I think that leaves about seven big
+ticket apps, in rough order of popularity:
+</p><p>
+<a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/AdobeDreamweaver">http://wiki.winehq.org/AdobeDreamweaver</a><br />
+iTunes<br />
+<a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/AdobeIllustrator">http://wiki.winehq.org/AdobeIllustrator</a><br />

+I've created wiki pages with trial download URLs for all but iTunes,
+and done a bunch of triage on them.
+Most of these could all use more triage and bugs filed.
+At some point the dust might settle, and it might become
+clearer which one(s) deserve to be focused on.
+I think Maarten is going to try iTunes, which would be great.

+   What about support for Autodesk products (such as AutoCAD and 3ds max)? As
+far as I know there is two group of problems preventing them from working:
+copy-protection related and .NET related. This is true for most recent
+versions.
+</p><p>
+       However for not-so-new versions there is no .NET issues (just copy-protection
+problems). For example this is true for 3ds max 4, 5, 6, 7 (but I didn't check
+this personally). I heard that it is possible to get 3ds max 3 working on
+WINE but it's so old that this is useless today but it gives hope that newer
+versions of 3ds max will work if proper support for copy-protection used by
+Autodesk will be implemented.
+</p><p>
+       This is true for AutoCAD too (as far as I know AutoCAD and 3ds max are using
+same protection called C-Dilla).
+</p><p>
+       Unfortunately, I'm not an expert on this topic so I don't know how difficult
+to implement proper support for C-Dilla. But if it's implemented, it is very
+likely that both AutoCAD and 3ds max will work (as I said, because of .NET
+issues, most recent versions may not work but at least not so new versions
+will work; in future, when .NET support will be better, new versions will
+probably work too).
+</p><p>
+       In other words, proper support for C-Dilla is most important thing for
+AutoCAD and 3ds max support so it is possible to temporary ignore .NET bugs
+related to most recent Autodesk products for now.
+</p><p>
+       By the way, AutoCAD and 3ds max are very popular applications. It's easy to
+check how they are popular by using Google. For example, for AutoCAD alone
+you will get 43,800,000 results [1]. So there is a really a lot of people who
+depends on Autodesk products such as AutoCAD.
+</p>
+</quote>
+<p>
+And Dan Kegel's response (which is a good conclusion for the issue as a whole):
+</p>
+<quote>
+<p>
+Yeah, getting .net working would be great, and we seem to be making
+some progress there.  And getting the copy protection used by these apps
+would be great.  Googling around, I see that C-Dilla has sometimes been
+called Safecast, which is related to Safedisc, so I took the liberty of updating
+<a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/SafeDisc">http://wiki.winehq.org/SafeDisc</a> with a link to the Autocad 2000 bug,
+<a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8466">http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8466</a>.  That one looks like
+it's waiting for some action - James pointed out a simple-looking problem,
+but nobody's tackled it yet.
+</p><p>
+I'm torn between tackling hard problems and just going for the
+low-hanging fruit.
+I think the upshot is: I'm going to push hard on the low-hanging fruit,
+and let the hard problems sort themselves out in their own time,
+since pushing on them usually tends to involve a lot of wheel spinning.

+WineHQ has been down a bit recently and some users have begun to take notice.  Jeremy White explains:
+</p>
+<quote>

+
+The server has been getting locked up lately.  Jeremy Newman thinks it's related to
+MySQL, as he's seen it running amok in conjunction with the crashes; he fears that
+recent changes to the appdb code may have triggered this, but that's mostly speculation.
+</p><p>
+At this point, there is little hard data; there haven't been console or other obvious
+log messages that would point at a source of the problem.  We do now have a mysql
+log file, perhaps that will shed some light.
+</p><p>
+It's definitely increasing in frequency, though, as it's happened both days this
+weekend.
+</p>
+</quote>
+<p>
+Jeremy Newman:
+</p>
+<quote>
+<p>
+WineHQ.org, AppDB, and Bugzilla are all on the same server.
+</p><p>
+We have been having some issues with mysqld crashing the entire server.
+It so far has been a hard issue to track down. I've been tweaking the
+mysql config settings to hopefully prevent this issue.
+</p>
+</quote>
+<p>
+And later, another letter from Jeremy Newman:
+</p>
+<quote>
+<p>
+As many of you have noticed we've been having a bit of server trauma
+this past month. The issue boils down to a bug somewhere in mysqld. We
+are still trying to find the exact cause of the bug. We do have some
+leads. I just wanted to do a brain dump on wine-devel here before I go
+on Vacation for a week.
+</p><p>
+The problem:
+mysqld will randomly eat up all resources on the system until the server
+is completely unresponsive to anything but pings.
+</p><p>
+My band-aids thus far:
+1. mysql is now running at a nice of 1. This should allow us to at least
+ssh in and kill it if it gets out of control again.
+</p><p>
+2. I've removed InnoDB table support to save on memory. Not many tables
+where using it anyway, and nothing is using transaction support at this
+time.
+</p><p>
+3. I've patched the appdb to use memcached for session management. This
+will reduce some load on the DB as the session table was busiest and
+slowest table of the appdb.
+</p><p>
+These fixes should give longer uptime, but they are not solving the core
+issue.
+</p><p>
+While I'm gone, if the server goes offline again, please contact
+Alexandre or Jeremy White. They can kick proverbial butt of the server
+to get it going again.
+</p><p>
+Lastly, sorry for the issues.

+Follow-up: A few days ago Jeremy Newman <a href="http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-cvs/2008-February/040624.html">disabled</a> a feature called "fuzzy search" on the AppDB which, thus far, has been the magic cure we've been looking for and reliability has gone way back up!

+Now it's time to winnow the list a bit.  1.0 bugs should

+The better understood a bug is, the more likely it is
+it can be fixed for 1.0, so even less important bugs
+can be 1.0 bugs if they're well enough understood and
+a patch is available.

+Here are a few bugs I'm thinking of deferring, and why:

+Not important enough
