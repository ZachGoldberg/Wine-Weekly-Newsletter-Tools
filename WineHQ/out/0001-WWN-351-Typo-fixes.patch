+<intro> <p>This is the 351 issue of the Wine Weekly News publication.
 Its main goal is to update the community on the status of the patchwatcher and other major august developments.  If this issue also helps to spread peace in the world the editor will be very content. It also serves to inform you of what's going on around Wine. Wine is an open source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.  Think of it as a Windows compatibility layer.  Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely alternative implementation consisting of 100% Microsoft-free code, but it can optionally use native system DLLs if they are available.   You can find more info at <a href="http://www.winehq.org">www.winehq.org</a></p> </intro>
