<ul><li>Newly added support for Lotus Notes (versions 5.0 and 6.5.1), 
	Microsoft Project, and Outlook XP</li>
<li>Merged codebases between CrossOver Office, CrossOver Plugin, and
	Wine.  That means CrossOver Office  
	<a href="http://www.codeweavers.com{$root}/products/cxoffice">now
	includes</a> all the features of CrossOver Plugin and there's
	no need to purchase two separate products.</li>
<li>A <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com{$root}/products/pricing/">new 
	licensing</a> program intended to appeal to the needs of 
	home users versus business users accompanies the new features.
