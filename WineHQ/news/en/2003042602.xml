  <title>WineHQ Server Crash </title>
  <body>
    WineHQ's web server died this week of catastrophic hardware failure. The
    server was offline for about 8 hours as we built a new machine and
    restored the files. Everything seems to be in place and functional
    again. If you notice things still broken and/or missing please
    contact us at <a href="mailto:web-admin@winehq.org">web-admin@winehq.org</a>.
    <br><br>
    Now back to your regularly scheduled Wine programming.
