  <title>WineHQ has moved!</title>
  <body>
    We moved WineHQ to a new ISP today. The website was down for a while,
    but now things are working well again. There still may be a few quirks
    here and there. We are on top of those and things will be smooth again soon.
    <br /><br />
    Now back to your regularly scheduled Wine hacking.
