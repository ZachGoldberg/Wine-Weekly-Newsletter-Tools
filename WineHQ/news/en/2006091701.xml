WineConf 2006 has just about wrapped up.  Approximately 35 developers
convened in Reading, England for the event.  A summary will follow,
but for now you can check out this year's 
<a href="{$root}/images/wineconf06_grp.jpg">group photo</a> (1MB).

The Wine team would especially like to thank Lars Mathiassen and the members 
of the 
<a href="http://www.tightpoker.com/">Party Poker Strategy Guide</a> for their 
recent donations that sponsored 
the event.  Putting on an event of this scale without a charge for developers 
is quite remarkable and their generosity helped immensely.
