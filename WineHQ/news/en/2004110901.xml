  <title>AppDB and Developer Docs Update</title>
  <body>
    <p>
     If you've ever aspired to become a Wine hacker, you'll appreciate a 
     <a href="{$root}/developer-cheatsheet">quick introduction</a> written by 
     Mike Hearn.  It's not a replacement for the 
     <a href="{$root}/docs/winedev-guide/index">Wine Developer Guide</a>, but it
     does serve as an excellent starting point for working on Wine.

     Also this week, Chris Morgan and Tony Lambregts modified the 
     <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org">AppDB</a> to allow folks to
     take over an application and become a maintainer.  Then you can
     edit comments, change app descriptions, and all kinds of other cool
     stuff.  If there's an app you regularly use under Wine, please consider 
     maintaining an AppDB page and help track regressions.  After you've 
     set up a normal AppDB user account, you can become a maintainer by 
     finding (or adding) an application and clicking on the maintainer
     button you'll find on each app's page.  Have any ideas for improving 
     the interface?  <a href="mailto:wine-devel_at_winehq.org">Let
     us know!</a>   </p>
