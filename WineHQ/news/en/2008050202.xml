<title>Code freeze in effect, on towards wine 1.0!</title>
<body>
<p>Wine is finally in code freeze in preparation for releasing wine 1.0, and
we need your help!</p>

<p>If you are a user, now would be the time to help us find regressions and
file them at <a href="http://bugs.winehq.org">bugzilla</a> so we know what
we have to fix.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/WineReleasePlan">Wine's
release plan</a>, wine-1.0.0-rc1, will be the first release candidate for 1.0.
It is expected to be released at 09th of May 2008.</p>

<p>The code freeze will be less rigid at first, but we're serious about not
destabilizing Wine at this point. So go ahead and post your patches, but make
sure you've got your ducks in a row, and don't be surprised if Alexandre
pushes back.</p>

<p>During the code freeze, patches that are simple, come with a conformance
test, fix a regression and/or are low risk are more likely to get in than
other patches. This has always been true, but it's even more true during a
code freeze. We will actively discourage patches that might endanger a June
1.0 release.</p>

<p>There are <a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/buglist.cgi?bug_status=NEW&bug_status=ASSIGNED&bug_status=REOPENED&product=Wine&target_milestone=1.0.0&order=bugs.bug_severity">
45 open 1.0 bugs</a> as of 2 May. Most of these will simply be rolled over
to be fixed for a later release; we only have time to fix a few, and much
as we'd like to fix the rest, most are not showstoppers.</p>
