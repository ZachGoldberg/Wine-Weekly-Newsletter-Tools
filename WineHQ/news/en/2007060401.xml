  <title>CrossOver&#174; 6.1</title>
  <body>
    <p>We're a bit late in reporting this, but CodeWeavers released
	version 6.1 of their CrossOver products on May 15th.  You can
	read the 
	<a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/about/general/press/?id=20070515">press 
	release</a> and 
	<a href="http://crossover.codeweavers.com/pipermail/announce/2007-May/000038.html">announcement</a> 
	on their website.  Version 6.0 brought the addition of gaming support;
	this release continues that trend by including support for EVE Online
	and more games playable through Steam, such as Call of Duty 2.  
	Outlook picked up some changes to enable better remote connectivity.
	All in all, it sounds like there's a bunch of new functionality, so
	it's probably worth checking out.</p>
