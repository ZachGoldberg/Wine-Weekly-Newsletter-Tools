  <body>
<p>
Wine 0.9.12 fell out of the git tree this morning.  Notable improvements
include:
<ul>
 <li>New Winelib Internet Explorer application (all 5 lines of it).</li>
 <li>Several improvements to the font support.</li>
 <li>More work on the IDL compiler.</li>
 <li>Faster drawing of the cards in Solitaire (very important feature).</li>
 <li>A number of fixes for issues found by the Coverity code cheker.</li>
</ul></p>
<p>
  Hear that?  Faster drawing of the cards in Solitaire!  I know you're
  all psyched about that.
