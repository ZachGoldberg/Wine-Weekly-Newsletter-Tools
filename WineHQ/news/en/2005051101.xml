We are pleased to announce the 
<a href="http://www.softwarefreedom.org/">Software Freedom Law Center</a>
will be providing legal counsel to the Wine project.  The SFLC stands
at the forefront of legal representation for free and open source
software.  Its distinguished board includes Eben Moglen, Lawrence
Lessig, Diane M. Peters, and Daniel J. Weitzner.  From the 
<a href="http://lwn.net/Articles/135413/">press 
release</a>:

"As open source projects are increasingly threatened by excessive litigation, 
technological successes must be partnered with solid legal principles,
said Eben Moglen, chairman of the Software Freedom Law Center. "The Wine 
Project is a particularly important example. By representing the Wine Project, 
the Software Freedom Law Center will enable further adoption of the project's
benefits and increase confidence among users."
