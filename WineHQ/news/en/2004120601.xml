  <title>Acknowledgement Page and Other Updates</title>
  <body>
  <p> We added 
  <a href="http://www.winehq.org{$root}/acknowledgement">an acknowledgement	
  page</a> last week to WineHQ.  We'd like to thank everyone over the years 
  who have made significant contributions to Wine.

  </p><p>Last week also saw more 
  <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org/">AppDB</a> changes.  Have you
  <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org/account.php?cmd=new">signed up</a> 
  yet to be an application maintainer?  </p>

  <p>Finally, Vincent B&#233;ron created a new 
  <a href="http://www.winehq.com{$root}/download-rh">download page for Red 
  Hat based distros.</a> Hopefully that will sort out some of the confusion 
  concerning the sheer number of packages available.
