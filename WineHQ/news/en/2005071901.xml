    Do you have a program that just won't install with Wine?  CodeWeavers
    <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/about/general/press/?id=20050719">accounced</a>
    a major initiative today to get programs to install with
    a current copy of either Wine or CrossOver.  If your application just
    won't install, CodeWeavers promises to fix the bugs in Wine preventing
    installation.  In return, you get to write a regression test that
    can be run to make sure future changes don't break your installation.
    It's a win-win situation for you, Wine, and CodeWeavers.  For details
