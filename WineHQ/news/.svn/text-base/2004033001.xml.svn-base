  <title>WineHQ Site Updates</title>
  <body>
WineHQ has seen quite a few additions over the past week.
We're now able to display the 
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/winapi_stats">completion 
of various API's</a> from release to release.  
The source to the 
<a href="http://appdb.winehq.org">Wine Application Database</a>
was released and is 
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/cvs">available via CVS</a>
(as well as 
<a href="http://cvs.winehq.org/cvsweb/appdb/">browsable</a>
via LXR.)  One of the first new additions linked apps
to bugs filed in
<a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/">BugZilla</a>.
The 
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/todo_lists">To Do List</a> 
has seen updates from several areas, including more things bumped 
into the DONE category.  Finally, Mike McCormack suggested three new
<a href="http://www.winehq.com/site/fun_projects">fun projects</a>
someone might be interested in tackling:
<ul><li>implementation of jscript.dll using Mozilla's SpiderMonkey</li>
    <li>implementation of Image Color Management, mscms.dll, using Little CMS</li>
    <li>implementation of cryptography functions using OpenSSL's libcrypto.so</li>
</ul>
