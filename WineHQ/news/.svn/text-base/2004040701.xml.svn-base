    IBM's developerWorks published <i>
    "<a href="http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-wine/?ca=dgr-lnxw04FineWine">A taste of Wine: Transition from Windows to Linux</a>"</i>
    today.  
    (23 April 2004 - <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:sDglkGiMh7sJ:www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/linux/library/l-wine/%3Fca%3Ddgr-lnxw11FineWine">Google's cache</a> still has a copy, but it's been removed from IBM's website.)
    For years IBM's articles have gone in-depth on subjects and
    provided more information than your average technical article.  This
    one is no exception and covers everything from  Wine's underlying
    architecture to creating a Winelib app.  There's something
    in there for everyone, check it out.
