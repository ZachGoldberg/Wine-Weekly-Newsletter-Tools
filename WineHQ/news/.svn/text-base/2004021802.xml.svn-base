  <title>More Site Updates</title>
  <body>
        <p>
	We updated some more pages on the site.  The
	<a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/who">Who's Who</a> 
	page has been rewritten.  Some new names have appeared,
	some old ones will be moved to an as-yet unwritten 
	acknowledgements page.  A small update to the 
	<a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/about">introduction</a>
	page should make finding some of our resources easier to find.
