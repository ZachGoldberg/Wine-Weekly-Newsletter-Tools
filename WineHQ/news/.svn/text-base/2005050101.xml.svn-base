WineConf 2005 has wrapped up.  Everyone had a great time, albeit pretty tired.
We have a bunch of people that really helped out and it's amazing how 
many people worked on a pretty seamless event.  Mr. Ulrich
Gemkow with the University of Stuttgart put together the venue and organized
the local student organization, Fachschaft Elektrotechnik und 
Informationstechnik (pictured above).  Finally, the
Wirtschaftsf&#246;rderung Region Stuttgart, David G&#252;mbel with ITOMIG,
and Jeremy White of CodeWeavers 
provided a bunch of behind the scenes support, including financial help. 
Thanks everyone!  
</p><p>We'll try to post a full summary in a few days.  We recorded the
presentations, so hopefully we can get those up as well.</p>
