    Tagged a few minutes ago in CVS:

<p>
This is release 0.9 of Wine, a free implementation of Windows on Unix.
After 12 years of development, this release marks the beginning of the
beta testing phase.  Everybody is encouraged to try it; while there
are still bugs, most applications are expected to at least install and
do something useful.
</p><p>
Because of lags created by using mirrors, this message may reach you
before the release is available at the ftp sites.  The sources will be
available from the following locations:
<ul>
  <a href="http://ibiblio.org/pub/linux/system/emulators/wine/wine-0.9.tar.bz2">
  http://ibiblio.org/pub/linux/system/emulators/wine/wine-0.9.tar.bz2</a><br />
  <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wine/wine-0.9.tar.bz2">
  http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wine/wine-0.9.tar.bz2</a>
</ul>
</p><p>
Binary packages for various distributions will be available from:
  <ul>
  <a href="http://www.winehq.org/download">
  http://www.winehq.org/download</a></ul></p><p>

You will find documentation on 
  <ul>
  <a href="http://www.winehq.org/documentation">
  http://www.winehq.org/documentation</a>
  </ul></p>
</ul>

It will likely take a little while for the binary packages to get built
(which we suggest you use.)  An official press release later today will
have more details on what you can expect from this release.
