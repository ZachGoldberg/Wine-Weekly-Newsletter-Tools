  <title>Web Site Updates</title>
  <body>
<p>A bunch of website updates have poured in over the past week.
Tom Wickline updated the 
<a href="http://www.winehq.com/site/status">status pages</a>, including the
addition of builtin versions of atl.dll, d3dxof.dll, dbghelp.dll, and mlang.dll.
Our <a href="http://www.winehq.com/site/janitorial">janitorial projects</a>
received a bit of their own janitorial clean up courtesy of Dimi Paun. 
They also saw  the addition of -Wsign-compare as a useful gcc warning to 
turn on (suggested by Mike McCormack.)
Finally, over on the 
<a href="http://www.winehq.com/site/download">downloads</a> page we've 
added Fedora Core 2 and White Box Enterprise Linux targets as part of the 
Red Hat packages maintained by Vincent B&#233;ron.
