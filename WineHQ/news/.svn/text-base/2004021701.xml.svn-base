        <p>
	Pardon our dust.  We're in the midst of making some updates
	to the WineHQ site.  On of the things you might notice 
	immediately is we've changed
	<a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/download">the 
        download page.</a>  We've combined source and binary
	downloads on one page and listed all of the individual 
	packages available for various distributions.  Have you
	<a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/download">tried out 
	Wine lately?</a>  </p><p>
        We've also updated 
	<a href="http://www.winehq.com/site/status">our status pages</a>,
	including new 
	<a href="http://www.winehq.com/site/status_porting">porting 
	status</a> and 
        <a href="http://www.winehq.com/site/status_options">Winecfg options</a>
	pages.
        </p><p>
	If you have any questions or concerns please feel free to
