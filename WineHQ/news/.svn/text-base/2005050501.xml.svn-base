<p>
We've got our own Wiki now!  Thanks to Dimi Paun for putting it together
the <a href="http://wiki.winehq.org">Wine Wiki</a>
and hosting it.  So far we've put in a user area and a developer area.
Feel free to add whatever useful information you think should be on there.
This is community driven, we can't do it without your help!</p>
