  <title>Microsoft Checks For Wine</title>

<p>We're on the radar screen.

Microsoft's new Windows Genuine Advantage program seeks to curb software
piracy by allowing downloads only to licensed copies of their operating
systems.  To do this, an executable named
<a href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/1/1/a/11a73739-0b11-4bf2-950f-cbd99511904c/GenuineCheck.exe">GenuineCheck.exe</a> 
(MD5 hash = 05499eaa4d4f55af32f5b14561ee7e55) gets downloaded if you go to 
their website with Firefox.  If you happen to look at the
strings in that file, you'll notice a reference to a registry key that 
looks curiously familiar: SOFTWARE\Wine\Wine\Config.  That little string, 
albeit subtle, happens to be the first Wine-specific test Microsoft has made 
in a program.
