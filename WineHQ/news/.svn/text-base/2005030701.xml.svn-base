	In belated news, we've updated some pages on WineHQ.  Tom 
	Wickline reviewed and made some changes to Wine's 
	<a href="http://www.winehq.com/site/status">status pages</a>
	To get a feel for the progress, check out the 
	<a href="http://www.winehq.com/site/status_changelog">status page
	changelog</a>.  Dimi Paun went through the 
	<a href="http://www.winehq.com/site/todo_lists">to do list</a>
	and marked a few tasks as complete.  Finally, we had a 
	<a href="http://www.winehq.com/site/janitorial">janitorial task</a>
	marked as complete to <i>use Interlocked functions in AddRef
	and Release methods</i>.
