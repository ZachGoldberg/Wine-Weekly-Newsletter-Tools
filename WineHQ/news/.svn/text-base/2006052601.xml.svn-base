  <body>
<p>Google just released <a href="http://picasa.google.com/linux/">Picasa for 
Linux</a>.  In case you haven't used it, Picasa is an advanced image archiving 
tool that also includes some basic photo manipulation features.  Interestingly, 
there's some technical details available about how the Linux version came to be.
The port was done using Wine and in the process over 
<a href="http://code.google.com/wine.html">200 patches</a> were contributed 
back to the Wine project.  The final product ships with a self-contained 
version of Wine and includes important features such as camera access using 
gPhoto.  Dan Kegel sent an email to the wine-devel mailing list 
<a href="http://www.winehq.com/pipermail/wine-devel/2006-May/047806.html">providing more details</a> of this unique port.  All of the patches have already
been committed and you'll find coverage of some of the specific contributions
in past issues of the Wine Weekly News.
