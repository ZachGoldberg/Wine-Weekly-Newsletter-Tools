university each morning. Note that responders to the April survey who requested
rooms will prioritised in the allocation of rooms.</p>

a room at the university will have to pay for it by 12<sup>th</sup> August
2006</b> and no refunds will be possible once you have been allocated a room.

a contact phone number and an email address.</p>

<h2>Tips From a Local</h2>
<p>The cheapest airport to fly into from Europe is Stansted since this is where
a lot of the budget airlines are based. However, it is also the most difficult
to get to Reading from since it involves getting the Underground to travel
across London.
<p>Gatwick and Heathrow are roughly the same cost to fly into and both are
relatively easy to get to Reading from.
