Wine for Ubuntu, Debian, and Debian-based distributions
<img src="{$root}/images/distro/debian.png" width="50" height="50" alt="Debian Linux" border="0"></h1>

<p>Debian and Debian-based distributions such as Ubuntu utilize a special tool
for managing packages known as APT.  APT is able to automagically install all of
the needed dependencies for a software package, as well as keep the package 
up to date, by scanning what are known as APT repositories.  Debian-based 
distributions have their own repositories of software that include Wine, 
however we keep our own repository of the latest available beta packages here for 
download.</p>

<p>There used to be graphical instructions here, however we have found that the 
terminal commands are actually simpler to describe and quicker for the user to 
input.  Because the commands below use sudo, you may have to enter your user
password after hitting enter.</p>

<h2>Warning: These are development packages</h2>

<p><i>The packages here are development packages.  This means they will 
periodically suffer from <a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/Regression">regressions</a>, and as a result an update may break functionality in Wine.  If the latest
stable release of Wine (currently Wine 1.0) works for you, then you may not want
to use the development packages.</i></p>

<h2>Adding the WineHQ APT Repository:</h2>

<p>First, open a terminal window (Applications->Accessories->Terminal).  On 
Debian, you will need to open a root terminal.  Then add the repository's key 
to your system's list of trusted APT keys by copy and pasting the following:</p>

<p><i>wget -q http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/387EE263.gpg -O- | sudo apt-key add -</i></p>

<p>Next, add the repository to your system's list of APT sources:</p>

<p><b>For Ubuntu Hardy (8.04):</b><br>
<i>sudo wget http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/sources.list.d/hardy.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/winehq.list</i></p>
<p><b>For Debian Etch (4.0):</b><br>
<i>sudo wget http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/apt/sources.list.d/etch.list -O /etc/apt/sources.list.d/winehq.list</i></p>

<p>Then update APT's package information by running '<b>sudo apt-get update</b>'.

<p>If you are using Ubuntu, you can now install Wine by <a href="apt://wine">
clicking this link</a>. Alternatively, you can install by going to 
Applications->Add/Remove and searching for Wine.</p>

<h2>Upgrading to a new version of Ubuntu</h2>

<p>If you are upgrading the entire system, such as going from Ubuntu 7.10 to 
8.04, you will need to come back to this page and enter the command for the new 
version above.  The built in update manager will not switch the Wine repository 
automatically.</p>

<h2>Older .deb packages</h2>

<p>Since the APT repository can only hold the latest packages, older versions of 
the packages are available at 
<a href=http://wine.budgetdedicated.com/archive/index.html>the WineHQ .deb packages archive</a>.</p>

<p>You can install the packages by double-clicking on them.</p>
