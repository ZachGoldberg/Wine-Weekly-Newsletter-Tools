<p><h3>The Wine Project Releases Wine 0.9, 
Declares Its Open-Source Initiative Ready For Commercial 
Testing</h3><br />

<i>Alternative Implementation of Win32 API Allows World's 
Most Popular Windows Desktop Applications to Run Natively 
On Linux OS</i></p>
<p>
<b>ST. PAUL, MN - (October 25, 2005)</b> - The Wine Project, 
the community 
of free software developers dedicated to opening Linux 
and other POSIX compatible operating systems to Windows 
applications, today announced the completion of the core 
architecture for Wine, an open-source project that allows 
Windows applications to run natively on Linux.  Now 
available as Wine version 0.9, the tools and libraries 
are functionally complete and ready for commercial testing
and optimization.
</p><p>
As one of the most anticipated initiatives in the open 
source movement, Wine has been long considered a key to 
establishing Linux as a practical desktop operating system 
for both personal and large-scale enterprise use.  With 
Wine, computer users do not need to buy a Windows license 
to run Windows applications.  The utility allows many popular 
Windows productivity and game applications, from Internet 
Explorer and Microsoft Money to World of Warcraft and Diablo 
II, to operate smoothly without the Windows operating system.
</p><p>
"Wine 0.9 marks the beginning of 'prime time' for Wine," 
said Alexandre Julliard, lead coordinator of The Wine Project.  
"The application has undergone major redevelopment in recent 
months, reflecting the work of hundreds of developers around 
the world.  Wine 0.9 is now a stable application with solid 
support for all Linux kernels.  While work remains to be done 
before Wine can stand on its own, we are excited and encouraged 
by this major milestone."
</p><p>
Among the most significant accomplishments reflected in Wine 0.9:
<ul>
<li>Winecfg.With the completion of winecfg, developers no longer 
  have to create customized configuration files for initialization 
  and application settings;</li>
<li>Separated DLLs.Wine 0.9 features a full set of dynamic link 
  libraries, removing the need to download DLLs from Microsoft;</li>
<li>Installer support.many application installers have been tested 
  for reliable operation, making the likelihood high for a smooth 
  install of many Windows applications.</li></ul>
</p><p>
Wine has been recognized by Microsoft as "the most popular 
third-party translation technology in use."  The application 
provides a development toolkit for porting Windows source code 
to Linux and other Unix-like operating systems such as FreeBSD 
and Solaris.  It also offers a program loader that allows many 
unmodified Windows programs to run on x86 processors using those 
operating systems.
</p><p>
Wine development has benefited from the extensive and continuing 
commercial/technical support of 
<a href="http://www.codeweavers.com">CodeWeavers Inc.</a>, a 
Minneapolis-based software developer specializing in 
Windows-to-Linux solutions.  Alexandre Julliard, in addition to 
his commitment to Wine, serves as CodeWeavers' chief technical 
officer.  
</p><p>
Wine is also available from CodeWeavers as a commercially-supported 
product known as CrossOver Office.  CrossOver Office 5.0, unveiled 
today by CodeWeavers, incorporates all the core technology of Wine 
0.9.
</p><p>
Commercial and private users are encouraged to download Wine 
0.9 for operational and technical testing.  To learn more about 
Wine, to become a part of The Wine Project, or to download
