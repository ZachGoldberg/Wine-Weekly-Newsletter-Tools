    Vincent pays the bills as a mechanical engineer.  With regard
    to Wine, he serves as the packager for Red Hat distributions,
    versions 7.3, 8, and 9.  Lately he's also been involved in 
    localization and various janitorial projects.

    Christian is an engineer who works on audio validation and emulation
    tools.  He first tried Wine in 2001 and began submitting patches the
    next year.  His first additions were for DOS support of DMA and 
    SoundBlaster emulation.  He moved on to Direct3D and DirectDraw
    and worked on the revival of that code.  Christian also added 
    Midi and WaveIn support to the winealsa sound driver.  Outside of 
    Wine, Christian enjoys playing guitar, snowboarding, and games.

     experience working for Corel.  While there, he ported
     the WordPerfect Office Suite and Corel Draw to Linux.  He's worked
     on numerous areas of Wine including the loader, the resource 
     compiler, common controls, clipping issues, the security API,
     and a rewrite of the clipboard just to name a few.  When Ulrich
     isn't working on Wine he enjoys taking courses at the University
     of Toronto and relaxing with his wife.

    Martin's primary focus of development is for the ReactOS team.
    As such, he's implemented much of the functionality of the 
    ReactOS Explorer.  In turn, that work required significant
    additions to Wine's shell32 DLL.  In the past he's also
    contributed to Wine's Winefile application and various user interface
    things such as common controls.

    Mike first got involved with Wine when he tried to make the Adobe SVG
    viewer to work in Internet Explorer so he could use Linux to do 
    development instead of Windows.  Since then he's worked on many different
    parts of Wine, typically by taking random apps and fixing bugs until
    they work.  Being a student takes up most of his time, but he fits Wine
    hacking along with his other project,
    <a href="http://autopackage.org/">autopackage</a>, into the gaps.

    The enigmatic Alexandre Julliard, who has been in the project
    since its beginning in early 1993, has worked on and maintained 
    the official Wine source ever since Bob Amstadt turned the helm 
    over to him quite early. Although he enforces strict control over 
    the official source tree (thus ensuring that every change must 
    pass his scrutiny), nobody questions his abilities as the project 
    leader, his commitment to quality, and his dedication to the Wine 
    project; many 'disadvantageous' patches have been avoided by his 
    strict quality control.

    Brian's regular job is supporting a large telecommunications
    infrastructure for a major ski resort.  He graduated from the
    University of Michigan in 1997 with an electrical engineering
    degree.  After college he worked for a small software development
    firm where he got his first exposure to Wine.  
    Brian's first real involvement with Wine began in 2001 by taking 
    over the Wine Weekly News from Eric Pouech.  After proving 
    repeatedly he has no talent for writing code he's decided it's
    best to stick with documentation.

   Paul is a consultant at one of the larger ISV's. He started
   working on Wine in 2004 to get some programs running for his
   kids as he was reluctant to give them administrator rights
   just for running games. In his spare time he's working on
   miscellaneous stuff to get Wine to a higher level.

    a driving force behind developing and promoting Wine.

    work.  He's responsible for keeping those updated and also 
    makes general improvements to the web site.  Tom has a knack
    for getting applications to run and can often be found helping
    others in various Wine forums.
