<p>Wine is an Open Source implementation of the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/">Windows</a> API on top of <a
href="http://www.x.org">X</a>, <a href="http://www.opengl.org">OpenGL</a>, and 
Unix.</p>

<p>Think of Wine as a compatibility layer for running Windows programs. 
Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely free alternative 
implementation of the Windows API consisting of 100% non-Microsoft code, 
however Wine can optionally use native Windows DLLs if they are available. Wine 
provides both a development toolkit for porting Windows source code to Unix 
as well as a program loader, allowing many unmodified Windows programs 
to run on x86-based Unixes, including
<a href="http://www.linux.org/">Linux</a>,
<a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a>,
<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/">Mac OS X</a>, and
<a href="http://wwws.sun.com/software/solaris/">Solaris</a>.</p>

is so important</a>, and <a href="{$root}/site/myths">Debunking Wine Myths</a>.
