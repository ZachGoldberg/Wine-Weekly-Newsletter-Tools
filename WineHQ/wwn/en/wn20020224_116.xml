  title="wine-license list, Lindows.com legal battle"

<p>First, a big oops on my part.  I submitted the last issue to
Zack with a large section on the Wine licensing debate.  However,
Zack received a few different copies of the issue from me and
the final one didn't have that story in it!  It seems an XML faux pas
on my part seems to have messed up the parser.  I've updated issue #115
to include it, please go back and check it out:
<kcref subject="Wine license change" 
startdate="02/06/2002"></kcref></p>

<p>With the creation of the new <a href="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-license">
wine-license</a> list all future mailing list stats will include both wine-devel
and wine-license.  This will be done by simply concatenating the two lists before
counting them.  The side effect will be anything that is cross-posted will be
counted twice, however I don't think that matters too much.</p>  

<p>The issue of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act has come up a few times
in the recent license debate.  Yahoo carried a Reuters article this week
titled 
<a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story;u=/nm/20020224/tc_nm/tech_copyright_dc_3;cid=581">
"Grateful Dead Lyricist Condemns New Copyright Law"</a>.  It treats the subject
fairly lightly while presenting both sides of the argument.</p>

<p>There's also <a href="http://www.lindows.com/lindows_michaelsminutes.php">
an update</a> over on Lindows.com about their legal dispute with Microsoft.  There's
<a href="http://www.net2.com/lindows/survey.pdf">
a link</a> to an interesting survey they conducted.  Michael Robertson declares the
survey shows "not even a SINGLE respondent was confused" between Microsoft's
programs and LindowsOS.  Then again the survey population of 14,001 consisted
of people who registered on Lindows.com's website.</p>

<p>Did you see the above note about missing the license debate in
the last issue?  Please go back and check out that thread:
<kcref subject="Wine license change" startdate="02/06/2002"></kcref>
This section picks up from there.</p>

<p>The license debate continues.  This week I'll summarize it 
first by looking at a few posts by Alexandre.  Then we'll move
on to the various threads.</p>

<p>The whole thread took a turn when Alexandre posted the following
message:</p>

<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
	<p>Folks,</p>
	<p>Here is the summary of the votes I received in answer to the request
	to switch to a copyleft-style license:</p>

	<table border="0" cellpadding="8" align="center">
	<tr>
	  <td>&nbsp;</td>
	  <td> Agree </td>
	  <td>Disagree</td> 
	  <td>Indifferent</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>All votes:</td>
	  <td>76 (70%)</td>
	  <td>15 (14%)</td>
	  <td>17 (16%)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>Contributors:</td>
	  <td>39 (66%)</td>
	  <td>7 (12%)</td>
	  <td>13 (22%)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
	  <td>Contrib. weighted:</td>
	  <td>59 (64%)</td>
	  <td>13 (14%)</td>
	  <td>20 (22%)</td>
	</tr>
	</table>

	<p>The first line counts all the votes I received. The second line counts
	the votes of all people/companies who contributed some code to the
	project. The last line counts all contributors again but with each
	being given 1, 2, or 3 votes depending on the importance of his
	contributions (this evaluation is obviously a bit subjective, but I
	think the overall trend is clear).</p>

	<p>The obvious result of this vote is that my previous conclusion was
	wrong: there is clearly widespread support in the community for a
	copyleft-style license. With 2 out of 3 contributors in favor of the
	switch, and less than 15% opposed to it, it's clear that we are going
	to proceed with the change.
	</p>

	<p>We now have to decide the implementation details, like the exact
	license used, whether to require copyright assignments, etc.  My
	suggestion is that we create a separate mailing list to discuss that,
	to avoid drowning wine-devel under yet another license flame war.
	</p>
</quote>

<p>Roger Fujii wondered,
<quote who="Roger Fujii">
As a curiosity, what % of the voters are affiliated with
codeweavers?</quote></p>

<p>Alexandre explained, <quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
 Actually I have counted CodeWeavers and its employees as one
 contributor. Only people who have done work for themselves outside of
 CodeWeavers have been counted separately. The total of all these votes
 represents about 10% of the contributors votes (and about 5% for
 TransGaming in case you wondered).
</quote></p>

<p>At this point a new mailing was created, wine-license.  You can
find all of the 
 <a href="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-license">Hypermail archives</a>
on the WineHQ web site.  Most of the discussion shifted over there 
within a few days.</p>

<p>With regards to the existing code, Kenneth Davis asked, 
<quote who="Kenneth Davis">
 Will there be a final release of the X11 tree previously maintained
 by Alexandre Julliard? (for those of us who do not wish to use a 
 version under another license).</quote>  Alexandre replied 
he would cut a final release under the BSD license before making
the change.  Kenneth also wondered if someone would be willing to
maintain the BSD tree to which Ove K&aring;ven responded,
<quote who="Ove Kaaven">
 If it proves necessary, I'd be happy to. I know I will not contribute to a
 LGPL-only Wine; I don't care much about business models, but if the Wine
 project will not allow my work to be used in someone's Xbox clone with
 NDA-ed hardware specs and operating environment (i.e. hardware-specific
 changes to the Wine core with no disclosure allowed), then I'm not
 interested in contributing to the Wine project at all.</quote></p>

<p>Patrik Stridvall felt it was too early to think about how the two
trees will co-exist since the only thing that had been decided was
<quote who="Patrik Stridvall">
 that we should explore the possibillities for some sort of copyleft license
</quote>.  Alexandre clarified that, 
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
 What has been decided is that we *will* switch to a copyleft
 license. Right now the LGPL is the obvious favorite, judging from the
 responses I got (even though the question was about copyleft, a large
 proportion of the voters explicitly said they favored LGPL).  I'm open
 to alternative solutions though, and you are welcome to make
 *constructive* propositions of other possible licenses.
</quote></p>

<p>With that in mind, Andriy Palamarchuk wrote:</p>

	<p>I want to start this thread to discuss advantages and

	</p>
	
	<p>Can we use the conclusions they came to - licensing

	</p>
</quote>

<p>Alexandre replied,
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
The main problem with multiple licenses is that as soon as someone
actually uses the extra permissions, by doing something allowed by
LGPL but not by MPL, or allowed by MPL but not by LGPL, this creates a
fork that can never be merged back into the main tree. So it sorts of
defeats the purpose of copyleft.</quote></p>

<p>Andriy wrote back with:</p>

	<p>The article says thag GPL is incompatible with
	NPL(MPL) because NPL has additional restrictions and
	conditions. What he exactly means?
	</p>
	
	<p>The article has many concerns which are applicable to
	Wine.</p>
</quote>

<p>It should be noted that because of potential incompatibilities 
of the MPL and GPL licenses the Mozilla project decided to adopt
the GPL/LGPL/MPL licenses just to make sure the MPL code could be 
shared with GPL'ed projects.
Anand Kumria summarized some key features of using the MPL:
<quote who="Anand Kumria">
<ul>
	<li> allows integration with xGPL projects (i.e. Gaelon/Skipstone)</li>
	<li> forces modifications made to the core code to be contributed back</li>
	<li> allows proprietary additions (i.e. Netscape's stuff)</li>
	<li> may also allow TransGaming's model to continue</li>
	<li> (downside) also means each file has to contain a lot of licence guff</li>
 </ul>

<p>The next thread was started by Gerhard Gruber,
<quote who="Gerhard Gruber">
 When I was thinking about the license issues discussed here I was thinkg
 about wxWindows. As it seems there may be similarities, because
 wxWindows is also a library that can be used in commecrial applications.
 Maybe if somebdoy looks into the licenses of wxWindows it might help.</quote></p>

<p>Andriy looked into and reported, 
<quote who="Andriy Palamarchuk">
 Their choice is pretty interesting. Quote from the
 site: "The wxWindows 2 licence is essentially the L-GPL
 (Library General Public Licence), with an exception
 stating that derived works in binary form may be
 distributed on the user's own terms. This is a
 solution that satisfies those who wish to produce
 GPL'ed software using wxWindows, and also those
 producing proprietary software."</quote></p>

<p>Andriy also gave a link to GPL-compatible licenses approved by
the Free Software Foundation: 
<a href="http://gnu.ctssn.com/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses">
http://gnu.ctssn.com/licenses/license-list.html#GPLCompatibleLicenses</a>.</p>

<p>Deven Corzine tossed out another idea.  This follows on the
idea of creating a "WineCorp" entity that had been suggested
before - namely a controlling group would be able to sell a
proprietary license to anyone that wanted one.  Deven's example
showed how Sleepycat Software worked:</p>

<quote who="Deven Corzine">
<p>Berkeley DB started as a small embedded database library which only
 supported hash tables and btrees. Since it was written for BSD Unix as a
 replacement, it was released under the BSD license. After a few years,
 it was widely used, but it still only offered access methods. When
 Netscape wanted more features, such as transactions, disaster recovery
 and multiple-user support, Sleepycat Software was founded to further
 develop Berkeley DB (on the strength of a licensing deal with Netscape).
</p>

<p>The new version of the software was released under the Sleepycat license
 [sleepycat.com], an OSI-approved [opensource.org] license which allows
 Open Source applications to use Berkeley DB, but (unlike the GPL)
 appears to be compatible with any Open Source license. For proprietary
 applications, Sleepycat offers a more traditional licensing option
 to companies who don't wish to distribute their source code. Revenue
 from such licensing funds additional development of Berkeley DB, to
 the benefit of all. (For example, Berkeley DB 4.x adds replication and
 high-availability functionality that surely would not exist without the
 funding received through this dual licensing.)
</p>
<p>Perhaps the Wine project should follow this example? Wine could be
 placed under a license like Sleepycat's, which would allow Wine to be
 freely used by Open Source projects (whether GPL or not), and proprietary
 companies could pay for a license which allows proprietary use. Funding
 from such licensing could be used to further develop Wine, to the benefit
 of proprietary and Open Source users alike.
</p>

</quote>

<p>Several people pointed out that putting all of the control into
the hands of a few people didn't seem like a good idea.</p>

<p>At different times people asked for a clarification of exactly
what was to be accomplished by using a copyleft license.  The hope
was that by defining the goals perhaps the best match could be
found with existing licenses.  Andriy provided a list and several
people commented on it.  The second revision was:</p>

<quote who="Andriy Palamarchuk">
	<p>
	<ol>
	 <li> Get all the modifications to our code back (copyleft license).</li>
	 <li> Allow reimlementation of any call of Windows API under different license</li>
	 <li> Allow products under different license to link against Wine</li>
	 <li> GPL, LGPL compatibility</li>
	 <li> protection agains patent claims</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
</quote>

<p>The only point contested was #2.  Dan Kegel suggested
something like,</p>
<quote who="Dan Kegel">
	<p>Allow proprietary programs to dynamically link to any set of DLLs from Wine;
	they should be able to mix and match Wine DLLs with their own proprietary ones.</p>
</quote>  

<p>Bob La Quey broke the problem down systematically and approached the
problem from a different point of view:</p>

<quote who="Bob La Quey">
	<p>First the disclaimers: I am an outsider to the Wine community but my 
	company OsoComm see <a href="http://www.osocomm.com/">http://www.osocomm.com/</a> 
	has recently done some contract work for Lindows.com.
	I anticipate that we will be quite active in this community during the next 
	year and so I am reading the mail archives, studying the technology and 
	generally trying to come up to steam
	so that OsoComm can be a good member of this community. Oh yes also IANAL 
	and personally favor the GPL.</p>

	<p>Now a comment on the licenses:</p>

	<p>The BSD vs xGPL debate is really very simple.</p>

	<p>First I will define three groups. Call them PA, PB and C where:</p>

	<ul>
	       PA = Programmers who see no need to earn money from writing code 
        	    under the license.<br />
	       PB = Programmers who wish to have at least a chance to earn money 
        	    from their code.<br />
	       C = for profit companies investing in software development.
	</ul>

	<p>xGPL says you MUST give code back to the community,  PAs tend to like this 
	license, PBs do not.
	BSD says you MAY give code back but you are not forced to do so, PAs do not 
	like this, PBs do, and C's do.
	</p>

	<p>It appears that all groups would agree to the principal that having source 
	code available would
	generally be a good thing if their economic interest were not threatened. 
	The puzzle then is how to arrange this.</p>

	<p>I propose a single license, call it the CPL for Compromise Public License.</p>

	<p>The CPL is a function of one variable Time. So we have CPL(T),
	where T is a period of time allowed before the source code MUST be revealed.</p>

	<ul>
	  CPL(T=0) = GPL<br />
	  CPL(T=infinity) = BSD.
	</ul>

	<p>T is essentially the time at which the license switches from BSD to GPL, i.e.
	the delay between the release of a binary and the release of the code for that
	binary.
	</p>

	<p>The resolution to the conflict is to use T to balance the needs of 
	investors of either
	time (programmers) or money (companies) with the needs of the community for
	open source.</p>

	<p>This is the same idea as copyright but under the "Sonny Bono Copyright Term
	Extension Act" copyright now has T=70+ years, which for software is absurd.
	If you look into the history of copyright you will find that Jefferson was 
	initially
	( 
	See <a href="http://digital.library.upenn.edu/books/bplist/archive/1999-02-11$2.html">
	http://digital.library.upenn.edu/books/bplist/archive/1999-02-11$2.html</a> )
	 opposed to it. He was a GPL guy, but Madison convinced him that allowing a
	 monopoly to the creator for a limited time was a fair way to balance the needs
	 of the creators and the community. I think some 200 years later this remains
	 the best solution.</p>
	<p>But we need a reasonable T.</p>
	<p>I think a T of six months to one year is probably about right, with six months
	 better than one year. This gives investing companies an opportunity to recover
	 their investment and still insures that the community gets the code, albeit
	 a little bit later than they do under the conventional GPL.
	</p>
</quote>

<p>There weren't very many responses to the idea by the time I kicked this
issue out the door.  So, there we are - a new license is in the works.  Stay
tuned.</p>

<p>Michael Cardenas wondered if it was possible to make his serial port 
use DTR flow control:</p>
<quote who="Michael Cardenas">
	<p>Is DTR flow control supported?</p>
	
	<p>There's a comment in comm.c in SetCommState that says it's not, but 
	EscapeCommFunction has a SETDTR case and a CLRDTR case.</p>

	<p>Below are the lines I'm talking about.</p>

	<p>I'm working on an app that asks for DTR flow control and uses overlapped 
	IO when using a modem. It establishes a modem connection, but then it 
	can't send any data over the connection. I'm using an external modem on 
	a serial port.
	</p>
</quote>

<p>Marcus Meissner suggested:</p>
<quote who="Marcus Meissner">
	<p>To my knowledge the serial driver of Linux does not support DTR flow
	control.</p>

	<p>So it might be a bit hard to implement in WINE.</p>

	<p>There is an article from Rein Klazes, 
	<a href="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-users/2001/12/0209.html">
		http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-users/2001/12/0209.html</a>
	could you try his suggestions?</p>
</quote>

<p>That article from Rein goes into detail on some changes to make
concerning selecting or not selecting DTR flow control and using
some different flags for that.  Mike McCormack explained in more detail
that DTR wasn't supported:</p>

<quote who="Mike McCormack">
	<p>However the Win32 API uses very confusing names, so make sure the
	app is really asking for DTR/DSR flow control.</p>

	<p>DTR_CONTROL_ENABLE does not mean DTR/DSR flow control is enabled, it
	means turn on the DTR line permanently. Only DTR_CONTROL_HANDSHAKE
	means the serial port should use DSR/DTR handshaking. (AFAIK,
	DTR_CONTROL_ENABLE and DTR_CONTROL_DISABLE flags are not correctly
	handled in the current wine... they should actively turn on or turn
	off DTR).</p>

	<p>Additionally, there were some problems in the
	GetCommState/SetCommState code that saw DTR_CONTROL_HANDSHAKE
	accidentally turned on, so make sure that it is really the application
	that is requesting it.</p>

	<p>As Marcus pointed out, the linux kernel itself does not support
	DTR/DSR flow control, but given the time and motivation, we could
	solve the problem if you really need to make this work...

<p>Arjen Nienhuis experienced a problem with a game he has using DirectInput.
He felt the key mapping method wasn't correct and explained:</p>

<quote who="Arjen Nienhuis">
	<p>The MapVirtualKey in GetDeviceState is not "the way to do it". It does 
	not map VK_?? to DIK_??. I don't know why it does work most of the time.
	"<code>ptr[i] = 0x80; ptr[i + 0x80] = 0x80;</code>" gave double key events in a game 
	I have.</p>
	
	<p>The correct way to convert the keys is by this table (attachment).
	I made this table by pressing all the keys on my keyboard, and record 
	the keycodes.</p>
</quote>

<p>Ove K&aring;ven explained what's going on,</p>
<quote who="Ove Kaaven">
	<p>It works because DIK_* is (at least up to 0x53, as far as I can see)  
	identical to the PC keyboard scancodes, and MapVirtualKey handles
	scancodes perfectly well. I really don't think this is a coincidence, I
	think this is so that Microsoft's DirectInput do *not* need the kind of
	mapping table you propose. If there's a problem with the scancode
	conversion, you should fix it in MapVirtualKey. I think you may want to
	keep in mind that the scancode tables in the keyboard code denote extended
	codes with e.g. 0x138 (0x100 + 0x38), while the DIK for that key is 0xB8
	(0x80 + 0x38). Perhaps the keyboard scancode tables could be changed to be
	compatible with the DIK codes without losing any functionality.</p>
</quote>

<p>As far as using the table Arjen created, Ove felt different keyboard layouts
complicated the issue,</p>

<quote who="Ove Kaaven">
	<p>Then that table would depend on the keyboard layout (country, language,
	etc). It should be enough to keep the keyboard layout table mess in *one*
	place in Wine (in the keyboard code, where MapVirtualKey resides), not
	two.</p>
</quote>

<p>So Arjen went back to his patch and worked on it so that some scancodes
used MapVirtualKey to do the conversion and others used a table to lookup 
the proper values.  He asked Ove what he thought of the change and Ove
replied:</p>

<quote who="Ove Kaaven">
	<p>Well, better. I still think it might be better to make MapVirtualKey
	handle codes above 0x80 itself, but I'm not sure.
	</p>

	<p>By the way, the problems we have with MapVirtualKey not having an
	one-to-one mapping might be solved by implementing map mode 3 (see
	<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/keybinpt_0hfd.asp">

<quote who="David Hammerton">
	<p>I'm presently modifying the X11DRV dibsection code for slight speed
	improvements using shared memory pixmaps and the like. Im into the "clean up
	and make it work on all systems" stage of thing, and I have a question.
	Do people ever worry about what happens if the user is running in a 1, 4 or 8
	bit X mode? This has some wacky code, which I am unable to test on my machine
	(or any machine around).. So i'm implementing what I think _should_ do the
	trick - but I have no idea if it will work..
	</p>

	<p>Is it a big issue?</p>
</quote>

<p>Hetz Ben Hamo explained his experiences:</p>
<quote who="Hetz Ben Hamo">
	<p>1 &amp; 4 bit - very rarely used (unless you're talking about monochrome screens 
	in embedded - by then 4 bit is important for gray scales..)</p>

	<p>8 bit - used mostly on old system with old graphics cards when 16 bit &amp; up 
	are slow - I'm talking about graphics chips like : trident 89xx family, ATI 
	Mach 8, Cirrus Logic (all ISA versions), ancient S3 chips, and Number 9 (ISA) 
	- on all of those cards it is better to run XFree in 8 bit or else you'll get 
	a totally slow graphics...</p>

	<p>Everything else today on X86 is running at least 8 bit and on 99% - 16 bit 
	and up...</p>

	<p>You might want to be careful regarding to 8 bit and up modes - like 15 bit, 
	24 and 32 bit. I think Matrox old graphics cards (with their 2.3MB RAM) are 
	using packed pixels so it could be a bit problematic...</p>
</quote>

<p>Mike Utke had a suggestion for testing:</p>
<quote who="Mike Utke">
	<p>I recalled Francois Gouget's VNC work from October and found the message 
	where he described how to use it to test various combinations:
	<a href="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-devel/2001/10/0278.html">
	http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-devel/2001/10/0278.html</a></p>

	<p>I'm now saying that this will work in 1, 4 or 8 bit configurations, but 
	it's worth a try.  It might also be worthwhile to make sure your code 
	works with several '-pixelformat's to test compatibility.</p>
</quote>

<p>Francois, in turn, suggested,</p>
<quote who="Francois Gouget">
	<p>You can use VNC to test 8bpp true-color modes, but I think David
	Hammerton had 'palettized' modes in mind. In that case, the only
	solution I can see is to run the VGA XFree driver. It's not as practical
	but is the only solution I know of. Pretty much all graphics cards
	should be able to use it as all it requires is VGA support.</p>

<p>Jeremy Shaw from Lindows.com asked:</p>
<quote who="Jeremy Shaw">
	<p>I am attempting to implement toolbar window message 0x463 -- which, as
	far as I can tell, is undocumented. If anyone has any information
	about it, I would love to hear it.</p>

	<p>I currently have a question about a difference in the implementation
	of comctl32.dll under Wine vs Windows. In both Wine and Windows, the
	function ToolbarWindowProc starts by calling GetWindowLongA (hwnd,
	0) and treats the returned value as a pointer to a structure.</p>

	<p>Under wine the structure is the TOOLBAR_INFO structure defined in
	dlls/comctl32/toolbar.c. Under Windows, I have no idea what the
	structure looks like. Using the debugger, I can see that the first two
	elements of the structure are the hwnd numbers of the window and its
	parent -- but after that it is not very obvious. The structure is over
	150 bytes in size.</p>

	<p>Does anyone know what the structure under Windows looks like? </p>
</quote>

<p>Guy Albertelli responded:</p>
<quote who="Guy Albertelli">
	<ol>
		<li>Most (if not all) the extended common controls (those in comctl32) seem
		to store their main implementation data via GetWindowLong(hwnd, 0). However
		we really don't care about the format of the MS version since our code
		*should* never interface with it. I have not personally seen any access to
		that in Rebar, Toolbar, or ComboEx. To avoid *trouble* I would suggest
		staying away from MS's version of the implementation data.</li>

		<li>From looking at relay traces, Toolbar messages 0x045d and 0x0463 seem to be a
		pair. They also seem to invoke comctl32.413 which is also undocumented. The
		relay traces seem to suggest that .413 somehow redirects the message to
		another Winproc. All windows that process through .413 seem to have the atom
		for "CC32SubClassInfo" added as a property (GetProp/SetProp). I suspect that
		this whole thing may be related to the "nativefont" control. There seems to
		be no ill-effect to the messages not being implemented (except for the
		annoying fixme).  Note that comctl32.413 may also be related to comctl32.410
		and .412.</li>

	<p>If you can somehow get the "nativefont" control to make a visual difference,
	then maybe we can implement some of this.</p>

<p>Eric Kohl added,</p>
