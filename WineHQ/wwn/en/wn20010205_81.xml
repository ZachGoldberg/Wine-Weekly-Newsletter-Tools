Marcus Meissner posted some report about a Borland announcement (
<a href="http://www.borland.com/kylix/">
http://www.borland.com/kylix/</a>), 
even quoting some parts:
<ul><i>
Borland will unveil its Delphi programming kit for Linux, called
Kylix. The product is designed to let people write software that works
with Linux and Windows, sources said. The software has been developed
with help from CodeWeavers, a group working to commercialize the Wine
software for running Windows software on Linux machines.
</i></ul>

<p />

>From various reports, it seems that Wine is used for porting the IDE
to Linux, however, the compilation toolchain seems to be a raw port to 
Linux.

Gavriel State announced a new version of the TransGaming D3D patch
(<kcref issuenum="76" sectionnum="1"></kcref> for more details):

<quote who="Gavriel State">
Just wanted to mention that a new TransGaming patch is available from
our web-site now. This patch is mostly just to bring our AFPLed D3D
work into sync with the DirectX changes that we've contributed to
WineHQ CVS lately. There's not much new on the D3D side, though we're
working hard with some hardware and sofware vendors to improve
performance there, which you'll see in upcoming releases.

<p />

The nicest thing about the latest release is that we've incorporated
Andreas Mohr's  SetWindowLong patch, which along with the work he did
on CreateProcess now allows InstallShield installers to work properly.  

<p />

The other big news item is that with our recent DirectInput work, and
a minor tweak to Wine's OpenGL thunking layer, American McGee's Alice
demo now works perfectly. The full version won't work, due to SafeDisk
copy protection, but we're starting to talk to engineers at
Macrovision to help us resolve that issue.
