<title>Kernel Cousin Wine</title>

<author email="brianv@ski-copper.com">Brian Vincent</author>

<issue num="104" date="09/25/2001" />

<intro>

<p>This is the 104th release of the Wine's kernel cousin publication. Its
main goal is to distribute widely what's going on around Wine (the Un*x
Windows emulator).</p>

<p>We saw a report come out this week that Wine has succeeded in
replicating even more Windows functionality - namely the ability
to run viruses.  The Sir Cam virus running under Wine is pretty
innocuous though as a
<a href="http://www.vnunet.com/News/1125594">vnunet.com article</a>
points out.  This does bring up an interesting point though.  Wine
has always strived for "bug for bug" compatibility and viruses are
part of that legacy.  But keep in mind that a Wine process running as a
non-root user will have a neglible impact.  By the way, does anyone else
find it strange that the press always uses the term "computer virus" when
they mean "Windows virus"?

<p>Aric Stewart submitted a patch that fixed a function (wsprintfA)
that was slightly different than its cousin (wsprintf16).  Andreas
Mohr asked, <quote who="Andreas Mohr">
Hmm, can't you add a small comment inside the code that actually
mentions this remarkable difference ?
I think we should make every effort possible to ensure that important
differences between architectures are being preserved as well as possible.
</quote></p>.

<p>As Bill Medland describes it, Alexandre likes to keep the code
"tidy".  And this is not the first time this issue has come up.
Alexandre did end up adding a comment noting the differences, but
Jeremy White felt it was important to address more general cases:</p>

<quote who="Jeremy White">
<p>Okay, so it's a slow news day, and I feel like stirring up trouble.</p>

<p>I would argue that it is, in fact, counterintuitive, to have this
sort of comment solely in the change log.  The only time I ever think
to look at a diff (or even the change log) is when something has broken
recently.</p>

<p>IMO, it is appropriate to comment in the code,
whenever something useful about Wine/Windows behavior is learned,
especially when the knowledge is something non intuitive
like the fact that the 16 bit version and 32 bit version
behave differently.</p>
</quote>

<p>Bill Medland replied, <quote who="Bill Medland">
The change log and cvs diff should explain why a change was made (and in an
ideal world should refer to the supporting documentation e.g. bug numbers
etc.).  In this particular case it should mention, as it does, that the
difference has been detected.</quote></p>

<p>Alexandre noted:</p>
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
	<p>Well, because *you* don't look at it doesn't mean it's not the right
	place, does it? &lt;g&gt;  I look at the CVS history quite often, and I
	find that in many cases it's the best way to find out why things are
	done a certain way.
	</p>
	
	<p>I don't see any reason to duplicate this info inside the code itself;
	since we are using a source control system we might as well take
	advantage of it. Plus it guarantees the info is stored permanently,
	unlike a comment that may get moved or lost next time the code is
	changed.</p>

	<p>I'd like to add that browsing the CVS repository on the web can be
	a great way to see changes to code.  For instance, in this case here's
	the diff between the changes Aric made and the previous version:
	<a href="http://cvs.winehq.org/cvsweb/wine/dlls/user/wsprintf.c">
	http://cvs.winehq.org/cvsweb/wine/dlls/user/wsprintf.c</a>.
	Also what stands out is the CVS tag leading to it.  While it's not
	always the quickest way to see revisions it does tend to make the
	differences jump out.  You can even get good ol' unidiffs from it.</p>

<p>The latest InstallShield-based installers have been an on-going
nightmare.  People have suggested writing everything from basic
interprocess communication to a full blown COM implementation.
Ove K&aring;ven has stepped up and worked on this and his latest
report asks for help debugging:</p>
<quote who="Ove Kaaven"><p>
Here are some kludgy patches (against the current WineHQ CVS) that's
supposed to make InstallShield 6 with its stupid interprocess COM sort of
work, but it doesn't for some reason, probably because of something else
in Wine that's broken... and because of a lack of time, I think I really
need some debugging assistance.
</p><p>
Most of these patches are too ugly to be submitted to the official wine
as-is, I'll clean these parts up later, but probably not before
InstallShield has been debugged and actually works with these hacks.
</p><p>
To make this run, you need to copy stdole32.tlb from a real windows and
put into c:\windows\system. Then run your favorite InstallShield 6
setup.exe and wait for it to crash. --debugmsg +ole is recommended. It
crashes for me after about 25 remote method calls. If you find out why,
let me know. Please.</p>

<p>Nick Hudson asked, <quote who="Nick Hudson">
        Well i know i'll get flamed for this but has anyone got IE 5.01
installed on wine?  Everytime I try it gives me an error that "Some
program hasn't finished and that I need to let it finish and restart
my computer"  Then it closes.  So any idea on getting any version of
IE installed? </quote></p>
<p>Uwe Bonnes suggested, <quote who="Uwe Bonnes">
Delete the files mentioned in the wininit.ini file (in the windows
directory) and then remove wininit.ini.</quote></p>
