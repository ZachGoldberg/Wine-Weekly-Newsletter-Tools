Patrik Stridval forwarded to wine-devel some good news from the gcc
development mailing list. The anonymous struct and unions patches have
finally made their way into the main CVS tree, and are very likely to be
available with next official gcc release. As already explained, this
will greatly help porting existing Windows code with WineLib without
having to change the code; Wine code will still use the named
unions/structs for some time.

Uwe Bonnes reported failure while running a program (<a href="http://home.worldonline.dk/andersa/download/DeCSS.zip">
<quote who="Uwe Bonnes">an obfuscated binary to rip CSS coded DVD Movie files to disk</quote></a>). Uwe felt that 
the PESHiELD protection could be the cause of it. Ulrich Weigand took a look at it, and gave extented details on how  
it worked, and what should be done to make it work under Wine:

<quote who="Ulrich Weigand">
<p />
<ul>

<li />Use Linux 2.2.x. (Linux 2.0.x won't work.)

<li />Use libwine.so. (Statically linked Wine won't work; if you must
use statically linked Wine, use -debugmsg +relay.)

<li />Don't use the internal debugger. (If you do, remove all dangerous
breakpoints, especially the automatically set start-of-task
breakpoint, before you start the decryptor.)

</ul>

</quote>
<p />
Ulrich also provided a patch to fix the last issues. However,
he was not sure that PESHiELD was widely used and wondered whether
or not the patch shall be committed to Wine tree, and if it would be triggered
on the command line.
