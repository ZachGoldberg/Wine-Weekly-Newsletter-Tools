<title>Kernel Cousin Wine</title>

<author email="vinn@theshell.com">Brian Vincent</author>

<issue num="123" date="05/22/2002" />

<intro>
<p>
This is the 123rd release of the Wine's kernel cousin publication. Its main goal is to distribute widely what's going on around Wine (the Un*x Windows emulator). 
</p>
<p>Over at the <a href="http://kt.zork.net/kernel-traffic/latest.html">Kernel 
Traffic</a> Zack included a note about the new system in place here.  Since it's
kind of interesting I'll just quote what he said:</p>

<quote who="Zack Brown"><p>
Kernel Traffic has just changed its publication system. It used 
to use a home-grown XML parser that interfaced with a database 
back-end to produce flat HTML, which would then be uploaded to 
the various machines in the DNS round-robin.

</p><p>The new system uses XSLT files to transform the XML into HTML, 
and uses 'make' to ensure that only the right files are rebuilt. 
Eventually the publication system will be released with version 
numbers, revision control, etc., but for now you can still 
view the files at 
<a href="http://kt.zork.net/xslt/">
http://kt.zork.net/xslt/</a>. 
The key XSLT file used to produce the HTML on the site is 
<a href="http://kt.zork.net/xslt/kt.xsl">
http://kt.zork.net/xslt/kt.xsl</a>, 
which in turn references files in the various subdirectories.
</p><p>
I'll have more to say about this, and some documentation, in 
upcoming weeks. For now I'm just letting folks know the files 
are there, in case anyone wants to experiment with them, and 
maybe send me patches and feature ideas.
</p><p>
Special thanks go to Joerg Heinicke and Jeni Tennison from the XSL 
mailing list, who wrote the &lt;kcref&gt; handler in 
<a href="http://kt.zork.net/xslt/html/misc.xsl">
http://kt.zork.net/xslt/html/misc.xsl</a>.</p>
</quote>
<p>
Damian Wojslaw is now  
<a href="http://kt.zork.net/wine/trans/polish/archives.html">
translating</a> KC Wine into Polish.  It looks great, but since
I'm not fluent in Polish that probably doesn't mean much.

<p>Head on over and grab the monthly wine CVS snapshot: 
<a href="http://cvs.winehq.org/cvsweb/wine/ANNOUNCE?rev=1.62&amp;content-type=text/x-cvsweb-markup">wine-20020509.</a>
Alexandre noted the following changes:
<ul> More dll separation work. 
   	<li />Many async I/O improvements. 
	<li />Still more unit tests. 
	<li />A lot less multimedia code. 
	<li />Many portability fixes, esp. for ReactOS. 
	<li />Lots of bug fixes. 
</ul>

</p><p>Francois Gouget posted some links to recent Wine articles
in the press.  In addition, he updated the 
   <a href="http://www.winehq.org/about/index.php?press">press section
   </a>
on WineHQ with some older articles.  The 
   <a href="http://www.linuxplanet.com/linuxplanet/interviews/4202/1/">
   first article</a> has a decent description of Wine, some of 
   the commercial entities involved, and even a prediction Wine will
   reach 1.0 some day.
The <a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/articles/AT3633344463.html">
   second article</a> discuss Linux penetration in the
   marketplace with a note that Wine provides an important element
   for Linux on the desktop.

</p><p>Last week's broadcast of "The Linux Show" had an interview
with Jeremy White of CodeWeavers.I've been traveling for a few weeks 
now (and fighting with dial-up connections) and just got a chance to listen to it.  
Fast-forward to about 63 minutes into it to hear the interview. 

</p><p>CodeWeavers released version 1.1.1 of their CrossOver Plugin.  
Notable additions include support for Macromedia Flash Player 6, 
Superscape Viscape plugin, and better Mozilla support.

</p><p>TransGaming will be at the E3 expo on May 21-24 in LA.  If 
you're in town, stop by and see them.  They'll be in a booth with 
<a href="http://www.transitive.com">Transitive Technologies</a>.
(Transitive seems to specialize in optimizing and translating
CPU instruction sets from architecture to another.)

<p>Andriy Palamarchuk has been spearheading an effort to
get developers and users to use Wine's 
<a href="http://bugs.winehq.org">Bugzilla</a>.  Part of 
this involves assigning owners to the various parts of 
Wine and informing those owners when bugs are entered for
their subsystem.  Andriy submitted a list of possible
component owners which generated a fair amount of feedback
from people claiming or not claiming responsibility for 
various areas.  Francois Gouget suggested looked at the
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/about/index.php?who">list
of developers</a> on WineHQ, but pointed out the list was
horribly out of date.  Andriy revised his list and 
resubmitted it:</p>
<quote who="Andriy Palamarchuk">
<p>
List of developers who contacted me:<ul>
<li> Guy L. Albetelli - common controls
</li><li> Robert 'Admiral' Coeyman - DOS
</li><li> Huw Davies - TrueType support, printing, gdi
</li><li> Francois Gouget - Winelib, Winemaker, headers, icmp
</li><li> Dustin Navea - wine tools
</li><li> Mike McCormack - file system, serial port, named
pipes, SMB
</li><li> Marcus Meissner - COM, OLE
</li><li> Andreas Mohr - documentation, installers, memory
handling
</li><li> Andriy Palamarchuk - wine applications
</li><li> Juergen Schmied - console, file open dialog</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Developers who has not confirmed nor declined
suggestion to own a component:
<ul>
<li> Alexandre Julliard - wineserver, kernel, IPC
</li><li> Laurent Pinchart - copy protection
</li><li> Dmitry Timoshkov - NLS, Unicode, keyboard I/O
</li><li> Martin Wick - sockets</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Still available components:
<ul>
<li> DDE
</li><li> loader
</li><li> msvcrt
</li><li> x11drv
</li><li> window handling</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Some developers are interested by areas which are not
components per se. For example - Andreas Mohr worked a
lot on installers issues and would like installer bugs
forwarded to him. The issue will be forwarded to a
person who is the most interested in an issue.
Everybody else is also welcome to give me your
particular areas of interest even if they do not match
component boundaries.
</p><p>
All the developers, QA engineers who is going to work
with Bugzilla, please create an account and request
privileges to change bugs status at
bugs <i>at</i> codeweavers.com.
</p><p>
You do not need to subscribe to wine-bugs if you are
not planning to work in the first line of the bugs
hanlding (handling of bugs with status UNCONFIRMED).
</p>
Please, let me know if I missed anybody.
Other comments are welcome too.

<p>Andriy also worked on 
<a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=95">
a form</a> to make bug submission easier and more accurate.</p>

<p>Gavriel State wrote in with a proposal for exchanging some
code that was developed by TransGaming:</p>
<quote who="Gavriel State"><p>
As we have mentioned before, TransGaming would like to offer a trade to Wine authors who
have decided to license their code under the LGPL.  We have a number of different
components that we have developed for WineX that are currently not in the LGPLed Wine
tree or the X11-licensed ReWind tree.  We are willing to re-licence some these components
and allow them to be integrated into the public tree, if we can reach an agreement with
current copyright holders of LGPLed code.
</p><p>
As we have stated, we do not believe that it is possible for us to do our work within a
pure LGPLed framework.  This is for a variety of reasons, ranging from concerns about
copy protection issues to working with proprietary platforms.  That having been said,
we would still like to make use of some individual LGPLed DLLs, and we will be very
happy to make any changes we make to those DLLs available under the LGPL as well.
</p><p>
Currently however, we cannot easily take an LGPLed DLL and ship it with WineX due to
changes that have happened in the Wine tree for DLL separation.  In order for us to
do this, the DLL separation work that has gone on in the Wine tree would also have to
be made available in the ReWind tree, under the X11 license.
</p><p>
We would like to see the following dll-separation related patches made
available to ReWind:
<ul><i>links deleted, see Archive Link above for complete list</i></ul>
</p><p>
We would also like to see some of the recent async I/O patches made available
by Martin Wilck and Mike McCormack in ReWind, and patches based on that work, ie:
<ul><i>links deleted, see Archive Link above for complete list</i></ul>
</p><p>
In exchange for this, we're willing to make the following code available to
ReWind (and thus to Wine) under the X11 license:
<ul>
   <li> All of the current work in WineX that supports DCOM and InstallShield
     (The WineX version of DCOM and InstallShield support works with
      every InstallShield 6 installer that we've tried)

   </li><li> Portions of our copy protection code that are related to low-level
     CD-Reading and reentrant wineserver calls.

   </li><li> A 2D DIB rasterization engine with full support for complex brushes and
     ROP modes.  The DIBEngine is configurable from the ~/.wine/config file,
     and coexists with the existing X11drv mechanisms for supporting DIBSections.
     IE: If the DIBSection is in gdimod mode, it will use the X11 primitives,
     and if it is in appmod mode it will use the DIBEngine if the DIBEngine
     supports that primitive.  Our work on the DIBEngine is ongoing.

   </li><li> Our up-to-date SDLDrv, the first really useful non-X11 backend driver

   </li><li> Various DirectSound improvements</li>
</ul></p><p>
A number of other miscellaneous fixes, such as:
<ul>
    <li> Support for Gamma ramps in desktop mode
    </li><li> WSADuplicateSocket support in WinSock
    </li><li> Mousewheel support in DInput
    </li><li> Left vs right alt/ctl/shift key mapping
    </li><li> DInput keyboard buffering
    </li><li> DirectPlay improvements</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Some of these changes are already available for viewing on the WineX tree on
SourceForge.  Other parts (ie: the DIB Engine, etc) will be made available for
viewing shortly.
</p><p>
In addition, we'll also be willing to redirect some of our engineering time to
completing any remaining DLL separation tasks in Wine.  Also, the work we intent to sponsor
to speedup the WineServer will be made available under licenses compatible with both ReWind
and Wine.
</p><p>
We have other things we're willing to trade as well, in exchange for more LGPLed code
being made available to ReWind, or commitments to dual-license other code:
<ul>
   <li> New under-development work on DCOM to get away from the current typelib marshalling
     hacks (this will also eliminate some of the visual glitches with InstallShield Installers)

   </li><li> XSharedPixmap support in the x11drv.  This vastly improves DIBSection performance
     in some cases, and compliments the DIBEngine work.

   </li><li> 3D Sound support in DirectSound

   </li><li> Improved support for winelib C++ apps, including msvcrt improvements and
     support for delayed initialization.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Finally, Alexandre has repeatedly charged that the public availability of our WineX
code is discouraging people from contributing games related code to Wine.  If the other
LGPL copyright holders agree that this is a problem, we're willing to consider limiting
the availability of our AFPLed code in some way.  We'll have to figure out exactly how
though.
</p>
We look forward to your feedback.
</quote>

<p>Alexandre sent a short reply,
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
 As I explained already, I think the idea of trading patches is
 fundamentally flawed. I also think Wine will be much better off in the
 long run by sticking to the LGPL than by giving it up now for a small
 short-term gain. So no, I'm not interested in trading any of my
 patches.

<p>Gerald Pfeifer wondered what was going on with a
global wine configuration file,
<quote who="Gerald Pfeifer">
 I noticed that in the absence of ~/.wine/config Wine simply refuses to
 start, and truss (on FreeBSD) and trace (on GNU/Linux) reveal that no
 other location is consulted for a config file.</quote>
 
</p><p>Alexandre explained what was going on,
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
 The global configuration is no longer supported at this point, mainly
 because it doesn't play well with WINEPREFIX. I'm planning to
 implement a more general solution at some point that will again enable
 global config files. At the moment if you want that behavior you have
 to create a symlink from ~/.wine/config to some global config.

<p>Lonnie Cumberland wondered:</p>
<quote who="Lonnie Cumberland">
<p>
I have been reading over the Wine documentation but have not come
across this yet.
</p><p>
I am interested in having a windows DLL that can access some
functions native to Linux.
</p><p>
For instance, possibly an application under wine that allows me to
add a new user to my Linux box.
</p><p>
My guess is that I should be able to write up a windows dll that will
talk to Linux. Is this correct?
</p></quote>

<p>Geoff Thorpe agreed, and thought the benefit would be huge,
<quote who="Geoff Thorpe">
Won't it be wonderful when some applications will actually work *better* 
under Wine than in native windows? Ie. under native windows, "click here" 
will just open IE or whatever, but under wine with a "talk-through" API, it 
could instead allow the browsing to be hosted either through the 'normal' 
windows API (presumably launching IE) *or* be passed out to a native browser 
of choice on the host system (mozilla, konqueror, whatever).
</quote></p>

<p>Francois Gouget pointed out that it's such a great idea that
it's already been done,
<quote who="Francois Gouget">
 The way to do this would be to be writing a Winelib library. This
 library can be used by the rest of the application, be it Winelib or
 native Windows, and this library can call both Win32 and Unix APIs. When
 in a Winelib library, calling a Unix API is no different from calling it
 from any other Unix library.</quote></p>

If you compile with:<br /><ul>

The magic is the defines of ok, todo_wine and START_TEST.

See this as proof of concept, I'm sure someone can make this
look better.

How do I make this happen automagically when doing "make tests"?

<p>He went on to explain:</p>
<quote who="Jakob Eriksson"><p>
What I want is for the Wine configure to detect that mingw32
is present, then modify Makefiles so that when "make tests"
is run, EXE-files are modified.
I also don't want to do #ifdef REAL_EXE or whatever in every
c-file, I want all that to happen automagically in wine/test.h !
I want the configure script to take care of all that and always
compile unit tests twice, once for linux target, once for Windows
target. (EXE)
</p><p>
Then a .BAT file could easily be created that runs all the EXEs.
</p><p>
Bang, native unit testing in a box!

<p>Steven Edwards offered some tips, then Alexandre offered
a patch:</p>
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard"><p>
OK I have hacked the makefiles to make cross-compilation
possible. It's a bit tricky because some parts of Wine need to be
compiled twice, since they are used both at compile-time and at
run-time. The way to do it is:
<ul>
<li> create 3 empty directories: wine-src, wine-gcc, wine-mingw</li>

<li> put the full source in wine-src, making sure you don't have any
  binaries in there</li>

<li> in wine-gcc, do:<br />
     ../wine-src/configure<br />
     make depend<br />
     make tools
</li>
<li> then in wine-mingw do:<br />
     ../wine-src/configure --host=i586-mingw32msvc --with-wine-tools=../wine-gcc<br />
     make depend<br />
     make
</li></ul></p><p>

This should build a full cross-compiled Wine. Of course most of it
doesn't actually compile at this point, but fixing that is left as an
exercise for the reader...

<p>Andriy Palamarchuk saw a reference Jeremy Newman made to WineHQ.org
and wondered why he didn't reference WineHQ.org.  Historically, 
WineHQ was a ".com" address even though it was an open source 
community site.  Jeremy explained:</p>
<quote who="Jeremy Newman"><p>
 The story is pretty simple. The .com site is the original name to WineHQ
 before and after Corel hosted the site. CodeWeavers originally
 registered .org to simply be a mirror of the .com site. But, since they
 are now both hosted on the exact same server it does not really matter
 which you use.
</p><p>
 It is my suggestion to use .org as the preferred as it seems to sound
 better than .com on an open source site.
</p></quote>

<p>This generated a bunch of opinions.  Everyone felt whatever
name was used should be used consistently throughout all Wine
documentation and references.  Jeremy White felt if it wasn't
broke, don't fix it.  But others pointed out that ".org" sounded
better, and now was the time to fix it (i.e. before Wine hits
1.0).  Alexandre complained that switching addresses would
generate twice as much spam in his mailbox.  Andreas Mohr then
called for a vote on the matter (which didn't seem to generate
many public replies.)

Christian Costa sent in a patch implementing 
preliminary support for DMA and SoundBlaster emulation.

Dustin Navea wondered exactly what it was for.  Andreas
Mohr explained that that all the old DOS games required
it and added, <quote who="Andreas Mohr">
Thanks for this very cool patch !!!</quote>
</p>

<p>Christian pointed out that it wasn't quite as exciting
as it might seem because most old DOS games don't run
under Wine.</p>
