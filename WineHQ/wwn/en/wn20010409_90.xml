<p>For personal reasons (mainly current work load), I won't able to continue 
writing the Wine Weekly News. </p>

<p>All the Wine community is currently looking for someone to take the job 
over. If you're interested, let me know, I'll help for the switch (as the 
edition process is done, it would be possible to have several editors, so 
don't hesitate to drop me a note if you're interested). </p>

<p>I sincerly apologize to all the readers for the inconvenience and the delay 
for bringing you the latest news from the exciting Wine world. </p>
