<p>Granted, <a href="http://www.netraverse.com">Win4Lin</a> isn't 
based on Wine, nor is it free (in either
the source code or monetary sense), nor can you use it without a
license for Windows.  If you're only interested in running
a Windows application on Linux and Wine won't work, you may be
interested in it.  I have no personal experience with it; the last
emulator I used was the first release of  VMware.  But I found 
<a href="http://www.osnews.com/story.php?news_id=1112">this review</a> 
of Win4Lin 4.0 interesting.  It sounds like Netraverse has done a 
good job with it.</p>

<p>Some news came out of TransGaming last week (narrowly missing
the last issue.)  I suspected an announcement was on the horizon when I saw
TransGaming was sharing space with Transitive Technologies at E3.
The <a href="http://www.transgaming.com/news.php?newsid=37">press release</a> 
from May 22nd says,<quote who="TransGaming"> 
TransGaming Technologies, in partnership with Transitive Technologies, 
unveil their game-porting technology that can allow Windows-based x86 
games to be simultaneously released onto multiple platforms. These 
include the Sony PlayStation 2, Apple Mac OS, set-top boxes, PDAs and 
wireless devices.</quote>  Okay, I'm not sure of the relative merits
of playing a Direct3D game on a PDA, but I can understand how useful
it would be to get PC games running on a PlayStation.</p>
<p>And seen in TransGaming's latest 
<a href="http://www.transgaming.com/news.php?newsid=36">development 
update</a> from May 17th:
<quote who="TransGaming">
In other news, we recently made a breakthrough with support for 
Civilization 3 - it has just started to work with the current 
CVS tree. We hope to have it fully functional in the next WineX 
release.</quote>  WineX 2.0.1 was also released on May 17th, 
I'm not sure if the Civ fixes made it in.</p>

<topic>Project Management</topic>
<p>Recently a lot of effort has gone into updating 
Wine's bug tracking system.  Old cruft has been
removed, new bugs have been entered, and old bugs
have been dissected into smaller pieces.  Andriy
Palamarchuk posted a list for anyone wanting to
get involved - and yes, you can contribute even
if you can't code.</p>
<quote who="Andriy Palamarchuk"><p>
This message is for those who wants to help Wine
project but do not know where to start.
</p><p>
We need contributors of a wide range of skills.
The minimal requirements are:
access to a computer with Linux (or other Unix-like
system) where you can use Wine.
</p><p>
We have a lot of tasks which are relatively easy to
do.
The fact that these tasks are easy does not mean they
are not important.
</p><p>
Examples of the easiest non-programming tasks
available:
<ul>
<li> we *badly* need application owners. An application
owner is a person who often uses some application and
will help to make it work perfectly under Wine.</li>
Does anybody use Lotus Notes regulary under Wine?
<li> confirm and research bugs in Wine Bugzilla
  <a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/">http://bugs.winehq.org/
  </a></li>
<li> Add a 'Debunking Wine Myths' web page [
  <a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=606"> #606 </a>
  ]</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
 Examples of the easiest programming tasks available:
<ul>
 <li> Help Wine hackers - document Wine debugging channels [
  <a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=638"> #638
  </a> ]
   </li>
 <li> Improve RichEdit headers [
  <a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=330"> #330 </a>
  ]</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Easy, aren't they?
</p><p>
Do you need more choice?
<ul>
 <li> file BUGS in the Wine source tree gives more
 information how you can help the project</li>
 <li> bug 406 contains list of issues which is easy to
 fix.
 Don't be afraid to fix all the easy issues, so nothing
 will be left to others. We'll gladly add more! :-)
  <a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=406">
  http://bugs.winehq.org/showdependencytree.cgi?id=406</a>
  </li>
 <li> suggest your help on wine-devel mailing list. Don't
 forget to mention your skills, experience and what you
 want to work on.</li>
</ul>

</p><p>
If you want to know more - just ask.

<p>Want to start a flame war?  Start a discussion among developers
about licensing.  Since we've already done that and have the
mailing list to prove it, it was time to find a new topic.  What
better way than to comment on a 2 MB patch and ask for opinions about 
coding standards.  Bill Medland fired the first salvo in response to
a legitimate patch from Vincent Beron that stripped trailing whitespace 
at the end of lines, <quote who="Bill Medland">
 how about agreeing the size of a tab or removing them
 altogether or agreeing always to use tabs for progra, indentation or 
 ....;</quote></p>
 
<p>Dimitrie Paun replied, 
<quote who="Dimitrie Paun">
 There no need to agree -- tabs are 8 spaces by definition. It's standard.
 As for the indentation size, I think it's time to agree on a size. 
 It seems to me that most of the code is indented to 4 spaces.</quote>
Vincent Beron felt tabs were better than spaces since they resulted in
one character versus one for each space.  Jeremy White jumped in to
mention, <quote who="Jeremy White">
 Every good developer knows that tabs are evil, and that
 four space indentation is the way and the truth and the light...&lt;grin&gt;
</quote>  Dimi pointed out that Jeremy was wrong, 
<quote who="Dimitrie Paun">
 Tabs are _not_ evil, tabs "defined" at anything
 else than 8 spaces *are* evil... The rest are good tabs!</quote></p>


<p>Andreas Mohr voted for indents set to 4 spaces.  Alexandre's 
opinion was, <quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
 Mixing tabs and spaces should be avoided because it makes the diff
 output unreadable. And of course the one true indentation is 4 spaces,
 but I'm not going to enforce that.
</quote></p>

<p>A few people felt differently and mentioned that if tabs were used
then the width of the tab could be set in the editor.  Most Wine code
is quite readable, so this thread probably didn't change anyone's
minds.  Vincent Beron went on to mention:</p>
<quote who="Vincent Beron"><p>
 there are a lot (>20000) of lines which have either some spaces/tabs
 or combination of both after the final ";" (or "," in the case of
 function arguments split on a couple of lines.)
 IMHO, it'd be better to remove them (although I admit it's mostly for
 esthetics reasons).
</p><p>
 On the same vein, there are also a couple of instances where the final
 semi-colon is doubled, eg: "return S_OK;;". I removed the second one
 when grep encountered them.</p></quote>

<p>He asked if Alexandre would accept a patch to remove extra characters.
Alexandre replied he'd accept a script to do it.  Vincent promptly 
provided a short 10 line shell script to parse all of the .c and .h
files.  Patrik Stridvall, the resident Perl guru, reduced it to,
<quote who="Patrik Stridvall"><code>
 find . -name '*.[ch]' | xargs perl -i -pe 's/[ \t]+$//; s/;;+$/;/'
</code></quote>.  When it was all said and done about 25k of garbage was
removed.</p>

<p>Leanne Tsang tested some of the new font stuff and
found printing didn't work nearly as well as the client
side font rendering, <quote who="Leanne Tsang">
 We tried to print Chinese on notepad but failed.
 We found that WINE default only writes western characters
 to postscript.  Is that true?</quote>
</p>

<p>Ian Pilcher replied first with the following suggestion:</p>
<quote who="Ian Pilcher"><p>
The PostScript driver itself has rudimentary support for the Unicode
BMP (U+0000 - U+FFFF).  It does not support multi-byte characters or
wide characters.</p>
<p>
You will need a TrueType font with the characters that you want to print
(the driver can't handle non-Latin PostScript fonts), and you will have
to configure the driver to use the font.
<ol>
    <li>  Tell the driver where to find the TrueType font by adding
        a <code>[TrueType Font Directories]</code> to your Wine 
        configuration file.  Something like this:
		<ul><code>
            [TrueType Font Directories]<br />
            "dir0" = "/usr/X11R6/lib/X11/fonts/TrueType"<br />
            "dir1" = "/usr/share/fonts/default/TrueType"
		</code></ul>
    </li>
    <li>  Edit the PPD that you're using and add the TrueType font to
        the list of printer fonts.  (You will need to know the Post-
        Script "FontName".  You may need to run the font through a
        TrueType-to-PostScript converter to get this.)
    </li>
</ol>
</p>
</quote>
<p>Ian described more details, then added, <quote who="Ian Pilcher">
It's a lot harder than it should be.</quote></p>

<p>Huw Davies hinted that a better solution was on the horizon:</p>
<quote who="Huw Davies"><p>
 We've been working quite hard on making improvements to the PostScript
 driver and now have code that should print any character that can be
 displayed on the screen (assuming you're using client side font
 rendering anyway).  The code downloads the TT font to the printer as
 either Type 42 (TT wrapped in PostScript) or for older printers the
 font gets converted to a Type 1 outline.
</p><p>
 It needs a little more work before we submit it to winehq so please
 bear with us for a bit.</p>
</quote>

<p>Ian liked the idea, but didn't want to lose support for the
current method.  He also thought there should be a way to turn
off font embedding.  Huw pointed out that only the glyphs needed
were embedded and not the whole font file.</p>

 of it applies to anyone interested in using the Mingw
 compiler.  Parts of the following have been summarized,
 please refer to his <a href="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-devel/2002/05/att-0707/01-Mingw_and_ReactOS_wine_porting_and_status_guide_v0.1.txt">Mingw_and_ReactOS_wine_porting_and_status_guide_v0.1.txt">

This document assumes you are using cygwin to configure and build WINE for 
a Mingw Target. Cygwin is environment used due to a set of bugs within the 
Mingw Unix Environment MSYS. Msys may work however it, the ReactOS build

<topic>TransGaming</topic>
<p>I'll admit to seeing this one on Slashdot first.  Coincidentally
I had my moderation threshold set pretty high, so I even read some
interesting replies.  A debate on the debian-devel mailing list
came about as the result of a package request for TransGaming's
WineX code.  Marc Leeman did a good job summarizing the thread. 
He outlined the history of Wine, it's recent license change, and
TransGaming's use of the AFPL license.  No real news.  He then
described the current problem facing the Debian developers:
</p>
<quote who="Marc Leeman"><p>
 Recently, a RFP (Request For Package) was put up on the Debian site,
 and a "developer" agreed on maintaining this package. The license as
 it is, allows to include it in the non-free archive.
</p><p>
Within hours after posting the ITP (Intent to Package) on the Debian
bug database and on the debian-devel mailing list, a mail from Trans-
Gaming's CEO/CTE Gavriel State was received, which indicates
1. "We noticed that you intend to package our AFPLed WineX package 
for release in debian (presumably non-free).  We would really prefer 
that this not happen, for a number of reasons."
2. " We would prefer not to have to change our license to explicitly 
prevent the distribution of binary packages, but if we have to we 
will do so."
</p><p>
There are two things in this mail:
<ul><br />
There are claims on the rights on the code, which are valid to some 
degree. The reasons they state are commercial (development =&gt; money 
=&gt; development) and possible confusion since the release of debian 
binaries based on their public AFP'ed CVS does not provide the full
functionality of the binaries they redistribute (amongst others, they
are not allowed to redistribute proprietary copy protection code 
used by games).<br /><br />
If you do distribute binaries, we will change the license to 
explicitly prohibit you from doing this.
</ul>
</p><p>
The reaction of TransGaming concerning the binary debian release of 
WineX raises a couple of questions, that should be addressed before 
pursueing the packaging any further.
<ol>
<li> Does the license allow packaging?<br />
Yes, I read through it and you can distribute binaries as long as 
you put the source available in some common format</li>

<li> Is the source free?<br />
Well, to some degree, not the 3 RMS criteria, that's for sure</li>

<li> Who is the target audience?<br />
I would think people interested in 3D and 3D games and development. 
I think it is pretty obvious that you are not going to satisfy a 
hard-core gamer, since there is no support for copyright protection 
and most of the tweaking is manual (downloading dlls for example).
I see such a package for enthusiasts that want to check the 
state-of-the-art in gaming without having to install windows (I 
recently checked the SoF2 demo with this, even though the game was 
only for about 30' in my HD).
I imagine it is also useful for people working with 3D graphics and 
programming on it (e.g. students develop in win32 and you do not 
want to let them show the demo on your GNU/Linux workstation)..
In both cases, it is handy, but most likely not enough to go for 
the commercial thing (one could do without it).</li>

<li> Should it be packaged?<br />
Carefully reading the mail from Gavriel State, I did not see any 
specific objections to packaging it, but to the inclusion of the 
package in Debian.  I guess it has to do with the possible target 
audience...
Part of the objections he made, are now addressed by changing the 
name to winex-light. Even then, I do not think this will be 
sufficient for them not to change the license to prohibit binary 
redistribution when included in debian.</li>

<li> Can TransGaming change the license?<br />
Legally I guess there within their rights to do so.
Morally (I never thought I would use this word) no. I have worked 
on some projects where I added functionality to code and I cannot 
imagine me restricting the distribution of the code from which I 
did not write the bulk of it.</li>

<li> Will it be in debian?<br />
As things are now, no...
Distributing it would only be temporary (most likely, it would be
cut off before it even reaches unstable).</li>
</ol></p></quote> 

<p>Gavriel State clarified several points concerning TransGaming's
stance:</p>
<quote who="Gavriel State"><p>
After having read a few of the comments on our request not to have WineX added to Debian,
I thought that I should clarify a few things.
</p><p>
First of all, we have made, and hope to continue to make, substantial contributions to
free software projects such as Wine and now ReWind.  I think our record on this front
speaks for itself to anyone who cares to browse the wine-patches archives, or look
at some of my recent posts on wine-devel.

As for the ITP, we have no intention of forcibly stopping Debian from packaging the current
version of WineX.  Our license allows you to do so, provided that none of the servers that
serve the non-free archive are supported by advertising, or other commercial activity.

We have merely asked (politely, I think) that you not do so, out of concern for our ability
to continue financing our ongoing development efforts, as well as to avoid confusion with
our full download release which includes support for copy protection, and binary DLLs
which we have the right to redistribute, but not to sublicense.
</p><p>
If Debian goes ahead and packages WineX despite our request, we will have to evaluate how
that is affecting our financial situation, and determine whether we should change our
license to restrict any future binary-packaged redistribution, regardless of commercial or
non-commercial intent.  It would certainly be our preference not to have to do so.
