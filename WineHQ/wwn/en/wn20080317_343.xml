<issue num="343" date="3/17/2008" />
<intro> <p>This is the 343 issue of the Wine Weekly News publication.
Its main goal is to sound the trumpet and alarms and bells and whistles and get people pumped and excited and ready and motivated for Wine 1.0! It also serves to inform you of what's going on around Wine. Wine is an open source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.  Think of it as a Windows compatibility layer.  Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely alternative implementation consisting of 100% Microsoft-free code, but it can optionally use native system DLLs if they are available.   You can find more info at <a href="http://www.winehq.org">www.winehq.org</a></p> </intro>

<p>
Wine 0.9.57 was released last week:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
Wine 0.9.57 was released today, with the following main changes:
<br /><br />
    * Support for multiple OpenGL pixel formats.<br />
    * Improved support for color profiles.<br />
    * Many window management fixes.<br />
    * Better fullscreen support.<br />
    * Lots of bug fixes.<br />
</p>
</quote>

<p>
Thanks to some big bugzilla cleanups we now have a list of closed bugs with each release!  These provide some interesting insight into the process and goings on of developing Wine.
</p>

<p>
Jim on the <a href="http://forum.winehq.org">Wine Forum</a> has <a href="http://forum.winehq.org/viewtopic.php?t=154">pointed out</a> that NVIDIA mentioned wine in one of their recent change logs, an interesting find!
</p>

<quote>
<p>
nVidia has release a new Linux driver (169.12) which could be of interest to some Wine users.  From the release notes:
<br /><br />
 * Fixed a bug that could cause OpenGL to crash in certain cases, e.g. when running Counter-Strike under Wine.

<p>
There has been an interesting effort to maintain good translations of some of the text within Wine.  Mikolaj Zalewski has been <a href="http://pf128.krakow.sdi.tpnet.pl/wine-transl/">maintaining</a> a page with lots of information on this process.  If you would like to help out in this effort feel free to post on wine-devel with an offer and I'm certain there are peopel who are willing to help you get started!

<topic>Wine 1.0</topic>
<p>
Dan Kegel, the Wine 1.0 release manager, has begun to put together concrete plans for the big release of Wine 1.0.
</p>
<quote>
<p>

I've updated <a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/WineReleaseCriteria">http://wiki.winehq.org/WineReleaseCriteria</a>
to be a bit more final.<br /><br />

I've also written a draft release plan; see
<br /><br />
<a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/WineReleasePlan">http://wiki.winehq.org/WineReleasePlan</a>
<br /><br />
Comments?
</p>
</quote>
<p>
I recommend checking out those two links for the most up to date information about when 1.0 will be released.  Alexandre Julliard had one comment to add which will likely affect the plans slightly:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
We need a code freeze and stabilization period before the release. My
thinking is that we should have a 1.0rc1 release, probably sometime in
May, and from that point on only accept small obvious fixes. Then we'd
have rc2, rc3, etc. as needed until the bug list gets small enough. And
by rc1 (or even earlier) any bug that requires more than a small simple
patch would be deferred to 1.1.0.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
Dan followed through and made the above changes, the release plan currently looks as follows:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
# 0.9.58 - 28 March 2008<br />
# 0.9.59 - 11 April 2008<br />
# 0.9.60 - 25 April 2008<br />
# 0.9.61 (1.0.0rc1) - 9 May 2008<br />
# 0.9.62 (1.0.0rc2) - 23 May 2008<br />
# 1.0.0 - 6 June 2008<br />
# 1.1.0 - 20 June 2008 <br />
</p>
</quote>
<p>Additionally there will be a code freeze for rc1 and rc2 during which only bug fix and maintenance patches will be accepted</p>
<p>
Dan Kegel has also sent in a post asking the Wine community to <a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/buglist.cgi?target_milestone=1.0.0&amp;resolution=---">vote for 1.0 bugs</a> so they can be prioritized for 1.0.

"I had set her up with a perfect Wine install. She had a bit
of software that needed to run under wine and I had shown her
how to install within that environment. Apparently, I wasn't
specific enough. It never occurred to Paula that the .exe
programs she had used on her XP machine were the vehicles for
many of her present viruses. To her, it was perfectly fine to
use those same .exe's...after all, she was in Linux, right?
</p><p>
I got there within the same hour and checked her
machine. Yep...Windows viruses will reside and create the same
havoc within a Wine environment. Now, I've seen it with my own
eyes. This time I reinstalled for her and made sure I found
all the infected .exe's on the Windows side and deleted them."
</p>
</quote>
<p>
There was then some interesting discussion on the mailing list about how to keep wine secure, about the interesting fact that viruses _should_ work in Wine.  Its best for compatibility of Wine emulates as many of the bugs from Windows as possible.  As far as security goes the verdict was that running Wine as a normal user for normal applications is fine.  However if you are intentionally bench-testing something malicious a virtual machine is the safest route.  Again, <i>never run Wine as root!</i>.

<topic>Wine User Guide</topic>
<p>
Since the new forum went up there has been a lot of interaction between the Wine developers and the everyday Wine users -- an interaction which hasn't really happened much before in a formal manner outside of #winehq.  This has brought up some rather interesting issues (read: small flame wars) and some interesting ideas for improving wine and overall an increased feeling that Wine should help out its users.
</p>
<p>
This, combined with the impending release of Wine 1.0 has encouraged many to begin to shore up some loose ends; one of which being the Wine User Guide:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
Hi,
<br /><br />
For our 1.0 release, we should have a polished users guide to help
people to learn to use Wine properly. I did a quick read of the Wine
Users Guide [1] and here are my comments:
* Near the top - mention virus / security issues, warn against running
Wine as root.<br /><br />
* Remove references to tools/wineinstall - does anyone use this anymore?<br /><br />
* Section 2.3.1 - mention ./configure --verbose<br /><br />
* Section 3.1.2.1 - are there dlls besides kernel32, gdi32, user32,
and ntdll that we should never use the native one? Add warning about
downloading dlls from the web.
<br /><br />* Section 3.1.3 - the default virtual window resolution is 800x600
now. Add documentation for the dpi setting. Remove references to
"desktop double buffering" - option no longer exists.
<br /><br />* Section 3.1.4 - document the advanced options.
<br /><br />* Section 3.1.5 - add a blurb about setting directsound emulation to
none when wine complains about it.
<br /><br />* Section 4.5 - mention the WINEPREFIX environment variable.
<br /><br />* Section 5.2.1 - mention including hardware / drivers info in bug reports
<br /><br />- Lei

<p>
It would be a great help if some users could go through the guide and comment on anything that's either too confusing, outdated or otherwise lacking it would be a great help towards Wine 1.0!

Good news!  It appears Wine has qualified and been accepted by the powers-that-be over at Google and we are now officially a mentoring organization for the <a href="http://code.google.com/soc/2008/">2008 Google Summer of Code</a>.  Maarten Lankhorst sends in the good news:

<p>
Hi all,
<br /><br />
Wine has been officially accepted as mentoring organisation for
2008!!!!!!!! Just thought I'd share.
<br /><br />
I hope this will be the best summer of code for wine yet!
<br /><br />
Cheers,<br />
Maarten.

<p>
I think he sounds excited :).  As you may know by now Maarten is our head organizer for GSoC this year.  Thus far wine has a <a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/SummerOfCode">reasonalby lengthy</a> list of ideas for student projects this summer, including the following:
