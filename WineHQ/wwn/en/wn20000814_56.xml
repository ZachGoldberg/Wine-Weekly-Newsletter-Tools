<intro>

<p />

This is the 56th release of the Wine's kernel cousin
publication. Its main goal is to distribute widely what's
going on around Wine (the Un*x Windows emulator).

Uwe Bonnes obviously had some issue with installer files:

<quote who="Ulrich Weigand">
For moving and deleting otherwise busy file, windows enters these
files to move in wininit.ini. At the next start of windows this file
is processed once early in the windows start up sequence. This is done 
by a MZ-executable wininit.exe.
</quote>


<p />

Uwe then asked if such a behavior had to be reproduced in Wine, and
if yes, how ?

<p />

Sergei Turchanov pointed out that: <quote who="Sergei Turchanov">This is true only
for Win9x. As for WinNT, there is registry value under 
<br /><code>
"HKLM\CurrentControlSet\Control\Session Manager"<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;PendingRenameOperations:REG_MULTI_SZ
</code><br />
which contains for each rename operation two lines - old and new name;
and if new name is empty then the file is deleted.
</quote>

<p />

Peter Ganten reminded he just submitted a patch that implements those
features. He also added: <quote who="Peter Ganten">the whole sense of
PendingRenameOperations and wininit.ini is, that under Windows you may
not delete opened files. Since application might expect this, wine has
to forbid deletion of files, which are opened by other wine processes,
too. So we need something to handle wininit.ini and MoveFileEx.

  title="strlen vs. lstrlenA"
  subject="lstrlenA exception handling"

<p />

Jim Aston, while profiling Wine code with cprof 
(<kcref issuenum="54" sectionnum="1">see previous issue</kcref>), found out 
that the exception handling around lstrlenA was a rather high
tribute.

<p />

Jim then wondered why such an exception mechanism was needed (running
without gave a performance improvement).

<p />

Marcus Meissner explained that Windows allowed NULL (or invalid)
parameters to be passed to lstrlenA, and in that case to return error
codes, hence the TRY/EXCEPT block around the function.

<p />

However, it would be possible to replace call to lstrlenA inside Wine
with their libc equivalent (strlen), for gaining some speed.

<p />

This has been committed to the CVS tree.
