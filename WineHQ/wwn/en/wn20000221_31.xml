<p />
This is the 31st release of the Wine's kernel cousin
publication. Its main goal is to distribute widely what's
going on around Wine (the Un*x Windows emulator).

  title="WineHQ web server"

<p />

There were a couple of issues with the WineHQ server this
week. Firstly, Bertho Stultiens, who is kindly hosting www.winehq.org
reported: 
<quote who="Bertho Stultiens">
There is a chance that some network-connections never will arrive at
the www.winehq.org server. This is due to extreme hop-counts between
networks. We have experienced hop-counts over 40 from our internal net
and I just discovered that the external computers also reach over 30
many times. 

<p />

The problem always starts after about 15:00 CET local time (09:00 EST)
and stops first (gets less bad) when the USA's eastcoast is getting
ready for dinner (24:00..01:00 CET). The increased traffic in the US
is resulting in rerouting of many packets and increased
router-involvement. Our network is almost completely routed through a
US-connection for USA, Australia and Asia traffic. However, I've also
seen problems within Europe. 

<p />

We are considering a couple of IPIP-tunnels to get the hopcount down,
but this involves serious work and will not be done all too soon. If
you have problems, please notify me with a trace from your local site.

<p />

Note: most Linux machines will not have problems because the default
TTL is set at 64 (RFC1700 page 64 use 'cat
/proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_default_ttl'). However, older machines may still
have their TTL at 32 (RFC1060 page 23 or even worse, at 15 as
recommended in RFC791...). I do not know about other OSes what their
defaults are, but please set them higher than 32 if you want to keep
on using the internet.

<p />

and a few days later, Bertho kept experiencing the Murphy's Law:

<quote who="Bertho Stultiens">
The network-card gave up (a ne2000 clone). The problem was that I did
not have another 10Mbit card at hand (only 100Mbit) and it took a
while to lay hands on a new card. But, as usual, not everything is
working instantly with a new card. The problem during the last 10
hours or so has been that the router's arp-cache refused to timeout
and I could not get packets out from 130.225.13.222 (winehq). Mainly
because the IP is an alias. However, I just got the network running
again and the whole site is accessible again (afaik).

Everything has been back on tracks before the week-end.</section>


<section 
  title="Of compilers and calling conventions"
  subject="Wine's dependency on the pascal calling convention (stdcall)"
  archive="http://www.integrita.com/cgi-local/lwgate.pl/WINE-DEVEL/archives/2000-02/Subject/article-164.html"
>

<p />

Patrik Stridvall started another staircase discussion with Alexandre
Julliard regarding Wine's adhere to the GNU's compiler.

<p />

Wine, as Windows, relies on the pascal (aka stdcall) calling
convention: a function's calling convention defines in which order the
parameters are pushed onto the stack: C (aka cdecl) pushes the
parameters from left to right, pascal does it the other way).

<p />

Most of Windows APIs are defined with the pascal calling
convention. So, when Wine implements a Windows API, the function is
(most) always pascal.

<p />

However, Patrik pointed out: <quote who="Patrik Stridvall">While GNU C supports it
(pascal calling convention), some other compilers like the Solaris
Workshop C compiler doesn't AFAIK. This is not very surprising since
ANSI C doesn't  require support for it.</quote>

<p />

Patrik then announced he had had some success making WineLib work with
Solaris Workshop C, which has the following advantages:
<quote who="Patrik Stridvall">The most important issue is the size of the debug
info. With Solaris Workshop C 4.2 the total size of the *.so files
with stabs debug info (used by dbx) is about 9.8 Mb. With GNU C
2.91.66 the total size of the *.so files is about 77 Mb. No I'm not
joking it is almost a factor 8 difference. Further more Solaris
Workshop C generates better code and compiles faster. Secondly
supporting more compilers is nice in itself.</quote>

<p />

Marcus Meissner pointed out that using latest gcc (2.95) and binutils
would reduce debug information (by merging it between different
compilation units).

<p />

Anyway, Patrik's main point remained: if Wine is asked to run, let's
say native x86 code (using the pascal calling convention) with regular 
code (using only cdecl calling convention), then there's a need for a
thunking layer. 
Patrik's main application was to be able to run Wine on Itanium (aka
Merced) and using it x86 hardware emulation part.

<p />

A lengthy discussion went on between Patrik and Alexandre. Alexandre
concluded it with:
<ul>
	<li />there are two different issues: adding a x86 emulator to
Wine and compiling Wine on a compiler without support of stdcall
	<li />first issue is a high priority one, whereas the second
isn't (gcc can be used, even if not the best compiler around)
	<li />changes for both issues on core Wine code shall be as
small as possible (mainly modifying the thunk tools and code)
</ul>

<p />

Final decision will be made on <quote who="Alexandre Julliard">a matter of cost
vs. benefit. And in the case of stdcall the benefit is so small that I
seriously doubt you can make it worthwhile. If you disagree, by all
means go ahead and implement it, and then we'll judge on the code.

  title="Do animals drink Wine ?"

<p />

Marcus Meissner, in the bunch of patches he submitted from the Corel
CVS tree, provided one with the following Changelog:
<code>Alexandre Julliard &lt;julliard@codeweavers.com&gt; (for Corel)</code>

<p />

A suspicious Ove K&#229;ven asked: <quote who="Ove Kaaven">I'm sure there must be
other people than me wondering... which Alexandre is this who needs to
have his patch submitted to Wine by someone else?</quote>

<p />

Alexandre answered: 
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
It is the Alexandre-working-on-behalf-of-Corel, not the
Alexandre-hacking-Wine-on-his-own-time; they are quite different
animals. 

<p />

The work I do for Corel is owned by them, and they can do what they
want with it; it may or may not end up in their CVS tree, and as long
as it isn't released to the public I don't have any right to put it in 
the WineHQ tree. Once it shows up in the Corel tree I could of course
merge it into WineHQ myself, but if other people do the work for me
I'm not going to complain... 

<p />

Even though Corel are very cool about this, and of course intend to
release all the Wine code back to the community anyway, I think it is
important to make a clear distinction, to ensure that I don't take
credit for changes paid for by Corel (or that they take credit for
changes I do on my own...) This is also why I have adopted the
convention of putting my CodeWeavers email in the log entry of all the 
patches I did on behalf of Corel.

<p />

Later on, Alexandre gave also an update on the 
<a href="wn20000124_27.html#0">Wine's license survey</a>:
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">I have received an OK from about 75 people, and more
are still arriving. Since I haven't received any opposition so far I
think it is safe to say that we will be able to do the change pretty
soon. </quote>
