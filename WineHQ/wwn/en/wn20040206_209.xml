<issue num="209" date="01/06/2004" />
<intro> <p>This is the 209th issue of the Wine Weekly News publication.
Its main goal is to officially begin procrastinating on taxes. It also serves to inform you of what's going on around Wine. Wine is an open source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.  Think of it as a Windows compatibility layer.  Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely alternative implementation consisting of 100% Microsoft-free code, but it can optionally use native system DLLs if they are available.

	title="New Filesystem Code Merge Commencing" 
	subject="ntdll / kernel32: #41"

<topic>Filesystems</topic>

<p>The big filesystem merge has begun, well, at least the patch submissions.
 If you're just tuning in, you may want to refer back to issues
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/wwn/184#Evolution%20of%20Wine's%20File%20Management">#184</a>,
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/wwn/189#Filesystem%20Roadmap">#189</a>
and
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/wwn/204#File%20Handling">#204</a>.
I think it's useful to reiterate exactly what the problems are,
this list comes from Eric's initial post back on August 19th:</p>
<quote who="Eric Pouech"><p>   
<ol>   
   <li>  no dynamicity in DOS drive management: user should be 
   able, in his/her session(1), to either change the mapping of a 
   DOS drive letter, or mount a SMB share somewhere...)</li>
   <li> mounting should be done session wide and not process wide, 
   and of course shared across processes</li>
   <li> ntdll and kernel32 are not separated regarding file 
   management</li>
   <li> devices (vxd and DOS) management is still a hack</li>
   <li> it may be necessary to introduce a notion of filesystem 
   for some operations (open, read, write, seek, close, dir_enum, 
   ioctl) in order to support several FS (unix, smb...)</li>
   <li> poor management of ejectable devices</li>
   <li> short/long file name conversion should be consistent (across 
   several processes in the same session, across several sessions)</li>
</ol></p></quote>

<p>About a month ago Eric posted a somewhat complete implementation.
At the time he had some details to work through, but the basic
structure was complete.  Of course, the secondary problem now
becomes how to merge this code without completely throwing the
CVS tree into turmoil.  It seems Eric has found a way and now 
individual patches have been created.  Below is a list of the
new patches and the Changelogs.  Eric has been tracking all of his
NTDll/Kernel32 DLL separation patches with a number.  This 
patchset began at #41:</p>
<quote who="Eric Pouech"><p>

let's start submitting the new fs code...
</p><p>
basically, you will need to have run this new tool on your configuration 
directory before we can go any further (otherwise, wine will give you 
some nice warning messages, and breakages could appear)
<tt>winefs --config--assign</tt>
</p><p>
see the previous wine-devel post for some more details.
</p><p>
ChangeLog:
<ul>
 <li> winefs, a tool for creating the files needed for the new fs infrastructure</li>
</ul></p></quote>

<p>...#42:</p>
<quote who="Eric Pouech"><p>
New volume management functions from NT
<ul>
<li> implementation of Find{First|Next}Volume[AW], FindVolumeClose,</li>
<li> partial implementation of DeleteVolumeMountPoint[AW],
   GetVolumeNameForVolumeMountPoint[AW], SetVolumeMountPoint[AW]
   (only works when mount point is at root)</li>
<li> rewrite of QueryDosDevice, DefineDosDevice for new fs scheme</li>
</ul></p><p>
Note: DefineDosDevice is now broken (until patch 47)
</p></quote>


<p>...#43:</p>
<quote who="Eric Pouech"><p>
Changes for device &amp; VxD management (kernel)
<ul>
<li> remove server/device.c and all the associated hacks</li>
<li> opening a device is now implemented as opening a unix file
   (either a real unix device, or an empty file for VxDs &amp; TSRs)</li>
</ul></p><p>
Notes: server/device.c has to be removed
</p></quote>



<p>...#44:</p>
<quote who="Eric Pouech"><p>
New scheme for type, label &amp; serial number reading on drives
<ul>
<li> rewrote GetDriveType[AW], GetDiskFreeSpace[AW],
   GetDiskFreeSpaceEx[AW], GetVolumeInformation[AW], SetVolumeLabel[AW],
   GetLogicalDriveStrings[AW], GetLogicalDrives according to new drive
   scheme (either from device or from files on hd)</li>
<li> removed no longer needed part from files/drive.c and include/drive.h</li></ul>
</p></quote>



<p>...#45:</p>
<quote who="Eric Pouech"><p>
Moved NT =&gt; unix path translation to ntdll
<ul>
<li> moved path transformation (according to new scheme) into ntdll</li>
<li> rewrote wine_get_unix_path_name accordingly (and exported it from
   ntdll)</li>
<li> rewrote RtlDoesFileExists_U to use these new features</li></ul></p>
</quote>



<p>...#46:</p>
<quote who="Eric Pouech"><p>
Moved file opening to ntdll
<ul>
<li> implementation of NtCreateFile</li>
<li> modification of server protocol:
	<ul>
   <li> create_file now uses NtCreateFile parameters (not CreateFile's)
     as well as NT path names</li>
   <li> create_named_pipe also uses NT path names</li>
	</ul>   </li>
<li> NtCreateFile can also open directory handles (CreateFile couldn't)</li>
<li> CreateFile now calls NtCreateFile</li>
<li> misc. cleanups</li></ul>
</p></quote>



<p>...#47:</p>
<quote who="Eric Pouech"><p>
Moved directory browsing to ntdll
<ul>
<li> Added NtQueryDirectoryFile</li>
<li> Implemented FindFile{First|Next} on top of NtQueryDirectoryFile</li></ul>
</p></quote>



<p>...#48:</p>
<quote who="Eric Pouech"><p>
Reviewed directory initialisation &amp; management
<ul>
<li> now storing system dirs as full &amp; long path names</li>
<li> rewrote a bit DIR_SearchPath to use better ntdll functions</li>
<li> nuked DOS_FULL_NAME structure</li>
<li> in Win NT mode, no longer remember the per drive current directory</li>
<li> in Win 9x mode, store per drive current directory in =?: environment
   variable (? being the drive)</li></ul>
</p></quote>



<p>...#49:</p>
<quote who="Eric Pouech"><p>
Various clean-ups
<ul>
<li> got rid of include/drive.h and include/file.h</li>
<li> move remaining functions of files/dos_fs.c to dlls/kernel</li>
</ul></p><p>
Note: files/dos_fs.c shall be removed
</p><p>
that's all for now

	title="To Do List Updated"

<topic>Status Updates</topic>
<p>Based on discussion at WineConf, Dimi put together a detailed
to do list for a 0.9 release.  What's somewhat confusing is this
is about as large as the current to do list on WineHQ.  So why
have we suddenly shifted gears and trashed the current plan?
Well, we haven't.  The current To Do list has items like 
"Cleanup the directory structure".  Below this is expressed in
detail as section I.  Other tasks have been merged into a
more logical order.  So...</p>
<quote who="Dimitrie Paun"><p>
 Here is the detailed TODO in all it's glory. We _really_ need to
 get this over with, so please help us out to get this release
 out the door. I'll mark names by the tasks based on conversations
 I had with folks at WineConf (and on the list). If you notice any
 mistakes, please let me know. Items marked with (???) have no owner.
 If you think you can help on any of these (including ones that do
 have owners!), please let me know. Help is needed and appreciated.
 If it's not clear what needs to be done for any of these, get in 
 touch with me, I'll be more than happy to help you get started.
</p><p>
 Enjoy!

<p>Under section H. item #1 as creating a "testing daemon".  Dimi
wrote back to the list to clarify exactly what that meant.  Basically the
idea is to write a Windows program and run it as a service on Windows to
automate testing.  It's feared that when we complete this great testing
framework and get it integrated into the website we're going to run into
a problem with people downloading and running tests.  At first it will
work, but then people may stop doing it.  So if we have a service set
up that checks for new tests, then automatically downloads and runs them,
we can get a solid community behind it.  More important is getting the
tests integrated into the website.</p>

<topic>WineConf 2004</topic>

<p>Jeremy White put together a nice overview of how the
WineConf logistics worked.  </p>
<quote who="Jeremy White"><p>
 Say, I wanted to thank everyone for coming to Wineconf 2004;
 as far as I can tell, a good time was had by all, and we may
 even have accomplished one or two useful things &lt;grin&gt;.
 I really appreciate that so many of you braved -30C
 temperature and two days of constant snowfall to
 come work with us on Wine - such insanity<tt>^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H</tt>
 dedication is admirable.
</p><p>
 I wanted to suggest that we get to planning Wineconf 2005
 sooner rather than later; I'm curious to see which
 European city hosts the event &lt;grin&gt;.  For the record, we're
 willing to be the major sponsor for the next Wineconf;
 we'll kick in some funds and person power to help make
 sure it happens.  However, I think it'll only work well
 in conjunction with one or more locals.
</p><p>
 I did have some closing thoughts and advice I wanted
 to get off my chest; there are some things I would do
 differently next time, and it's probably also wise
 to touch on the things that worked well.
</p><p>
In no particular order, here are a number of thoughts:
<ol>
<li>  Screw fancy audio/video streaming.
	<br />
     Find an inexpensive telephone conference service,
     and use it.  Test it, several weeks in advance,
     *with the intended audience* (the stream worked
     fine on this side of the Atlantic, afaict), and
     *with the expected load*.  Our tests were always
     done with less load than we had during wineconf,
     because the streaming traffic used the same pipe
     as the 'net connection everyone was using.
	<br />
     We wasted a lot of time and energy on this,
     against my initial better judgement, and it
     proved to be largely useless, afaict
     from the #wineconf comments.
	<br />
     Go low tech.  Swallow your geek pride.
     Just get simple audio that works.
	<br />
     /me kicks self


</li><li>  Things that worked well:
     <ul>
     <li>  An inexpensive location	<br />
         Not one person opted for the expensive
         hotel I listed; cost really matters
         to this crowd.  The last thing we want to
         do is scare away young people; they often
         have enormous energy and no cash.  Help
         with hostels and friends with floors was appreciated.</li>

     <li>  Breaks	<br />
         The only times that I was sure that productive
         conversations were occurring was during the breaks.
         Provide lots of 'em.  Go very light on
         scheduled topics.</li>

     <li>  Do lunch in; that worked really well.	<br />
         Have lots of food and beverages about, that
         also seems to work well.  Bring the water
         cooler down on the *first* day &lt;grin&gt;.</li>

     <li>  Internet connectivity is a must.  Really.	<br />
         And provide both wireless and wired.  We had
         some grumpy campers when we initially didn't
         have enough cat5 ports.</li>

     <li>  All of the professional conference paraphenalia	
         was invaluable.  A wireless mic (preferably two)
         and someone to operate it.  A PA type system.
         A projector.  Even with the relatively small group
         we had it was invaluable.</li>
     </ul>

</li><li>  Suggestion - blue collar location
	<br />
     I know it's fashionable to suggest fancy vacation spots
     for Wineconf 2005, but I honestly think it would be
     much better to pick a 'blue collar' venue.  Pick somewhere
     that is a transportation hub, with modest prices.
     Someplace where some Wine hackers live; having local
     help is incredibly valuable (thanks to Mandi, Chris,
     Jon, Aric, Zak, Newman, and all of the gang who did so much work).
	<br />
     In fact, when we did go to the fancy tourist night spot,
     we ended up at a bar where it was too loud to talk; conversation
     amongst folks from 10 different countries is hard enough
     without load blaring music or odd ball distractions.
	<br />
     A quite room and a good supply of ale, perhaps with a whiteboard,
     is what folks mostly craved.
	<br />
     This is just my $0.02; I think others would differ sharply.
</li><li>  The final, critical piece of advice
	<br />
     Don't type 'ifconfig eth0 down' in a terminal Window
     on the Mac in an attempt to reinitialize it's DHCP
     settings, unless you're dead certain you haven't
     ssh'd over to the server that is the life blood of your
     community, and is physically miles away behind locked doors...
	<br />
     ...and I still can't figure out why Alexandre won't
     take my patches! &lt;grin&gt;

At any rate, I feel much better now - thanks for listening,
and thanks for coming.

 It definitely seems a lot more was done right than what wasn't.  
 The streaming audio/video was a bummer, and a lot of people 
 genuinely tried hard to get it working.  The facilities worked
 out extremely well though.  I think we all took it for granted
 we had basic amenities like conference tables and a video
 projector.</p>

<p> A new irc channel has been set up expressly for people 
developing Wine.  The goal of this channel has nothing to do
getting applications to run or serving as tech support.  It's
for developers to get together and solve problems.  We have lots
of forums available for helping with using Wine, including
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/documentation">documentation</a>,
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/forums">mailing lists</a>,
and <a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/">BugZilla</a>.  Mike Hearn
announced the new IRC channel on Sunday:</p>
<quote who="Mike Hearn"><p>

One of the action items decided on at wineconf was to set up an IRC
channel for Wine developers. This channel now exists and is
#winehackers. Key points to be aware of are:
<ul>
<li> It's on freenode</li>

<li> It is for developers only, user tech support (how do i run
counterstrike?) etc should be/will be bounced to #winehq</li>

<li> There are a  lot of ops. This is intentional. Often on #winehq there are
problems caused by users but there are no ops around (only like 3 guys
have op access to it). Me (TD), Mike McCormack (mike_m) and Francois
Gouget (fgouget) have the ability to add people to the auto-op list
through virtue of being the first guys into the channel.</li>

<li> The channel is modelled after #gnome-hackers on gimpnet, which has been
a great success with buy-in from even their busiest, most core hackers
(hint hint alexandre :)</li>

<li> All wine hackers are welcome, this most explicitly includes WineX dudes</li>

<li> No topic is offtopic. </li></ul></p><p>

Have fun! I'll submit a patch to add mention of it to the WineHQ website,
but #gnome-hackers grew to a huge number of people just through word of
mouth so there's no real hurry. Tell your friends,  rescue budding wine
hackers from the helpdesk that is #winehq etc. It's a resource that is
there to be used, so use it.

I'm trying to find a file copy tool which works on windows as well as wine.
I tried several and this looked promising:
<ul>
<a href="ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/fileutil/cc108dos.zip">
ftp://ftp.simtel.net/pub/simtelnet/msdos/fileutil/cc108dos.zip</a></ul></p><p>

On Windows it copied all files without problems and kept the long filenames
even if the name implies that it's DOS-only, but it worked fine on W2K.
But on wine the long names where all shortened to something like
CINO~E2H.CPP. So it doesn't look like normal DOS short names ...~1.cpp
but it's not the long name either. Can anybody try this out?
</p><p>
My wine (actual cvs) config is set to windows version nt40.

<p>Ove K&#229;ven explained the differences:</p>
<quote who="Ove Kaaven"><p>
It's the short names Wine makes when there is no DOS short name (i.e.
when you're not on a VFAT partition).
</p><p>
Try win95. Wine currently only emulates the DOS long file name API on
win9x, since it did not exist on nt4.</p></quote>

<p>Dimi thought that was odd,
<quote who="Dimitrie Paun">
That makes no sense: we get short names on a system (nt4) that
fundamentally had long names. Shouldn't we get long names by
default in that case?</quote></p>

<p>Ove went into more detail:</p>
<quote who="Ove Kaaven"><p>
No, you couldn't get long file names in DOS programs under NT4. Try to
run command.com (a DOS app) instead of cmd.exe (a Win32 console app)
under NT4 sometime. NT4 had generally poor DOS support, mostly because
its kernel was not DOS; Win95 had much better DOS support because of its
DOS-based kernel, and that kernel provided long file name services to
DOS programs running under it (on a VFAT partition).
</p><p>
Now it's possible that 2000 and XP added Win95-compatible long file name
services for DOS programs, in which case the version check in Wine for
the LFN DOS API could be updated. The version check is anyway (probably)
mostly there to prevent winver=win311 from enabling the LFN API.
