  title="News: Xandros Beta, CodeWeavers Wine Preview 6"
  subject="News"

<topic>News</topic>
One company you don't hear a lot about (yet?) is Xandros.  Xandros acquired 
Corel's Linux distribution when Corel got out of the Linux desktop business
in August of last year.  More importantly, they have some of ex-Corel guys
working for them.  
You can still find an ISO image of the 
<a href="http://www.xandros.com/downloads.html">Corel distribution</a> on
their website but  
Xandros is in the process of creating their own product offerings now. They
had a call for beta testers a while ago that I totally overlooked.  You probably wouldn't
have gotten in if you wanted to - 2,000 people applied and 150 were selected.

<p />On their <a href="http://www.xandros.com/company.html">about</a> page they
describe what they're working on:
<quote who="Xandros">
   Xandros is developing a customized Debian-based Linux distribution 
   that is derived from version 3.0 of the award winning Corel LINUX OS. 
   It will support both the KDE and Gnome desktop environments. In addition 
   to the features that Linux users expect, Xandros will be distributing 
   significant additions and enhancements. Furthermore, Xandros is creating 
   a server and enterprise management solution that will significantly 
   reduce the total cost of ownership of computing environments. The overall 
   solution is complete "off the shelf", but Xandros Professional Services 
   can customize and integrate the products as well as provide enhancements 
   to legacy systems as needed. Finally, all Xandros offerings will be backed 
   by world-class support.
</quote>

<p />Xandros plans on releasing their software within the coming months, so
stay tuned.

<p />One thing I definitely missed last month was CodeWeavers 
<a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/technology/wine/download.php">Wine Preview
6</a>.  Dated from April 11th, it came out shortly after the announcement of
CodeWeavers Office.  CodeWeavers wine is known for it's ease of installation,
integration with Gnome and KDE, and having some of the fixes (or, sometimes,
ugly hacks that work) that haven't made it into the official Wine CVS.  Their
releases are somewhat infrequent with the last being five months ago.  However,
if you haven't tried Wine in a while and aren't comfortable 

<a href="/index.php?page=cvs">with CVS</a>, 
<a href="http://source.winehq.org/source/ANNOUNCE">tarballs</a>, or even
getting one of the
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/download/">daily builds</a> 
you might want to try out their RPM.  It's free, so if you break it you can 
keep all the pieces.  

<p />Interesting trivia #1 - CodeWeavers Wine is the most downloaded piece of
software by members of Mandrakesoft's Mandrake Club.  

<p />
Also this week, <a href="http://www.linuxlookup.com/html/reviews/software/transgamingwinex.html">
a review</a> of TransGaming's WineX 2.0.  Notable quotable,
<quote who="Mark">I haven't done much to optimize my Linux box for gaming...but I was 
happy to have a game that has not been ported for Linux running without hangs or crashes.
</quote>

<p />
And, also on the TransGaming front, there's a way for subscribers
to get credit for their friends subscribing.  If you follow
this link:
 <a href=" http://www.transgaming.com/create_accnt.php?referer=vinn">
  http://www.transgaming.com/create_accnt.php?referer=vinn</a> and 
subscribe I get credit for it.  This in no way endorses TransGaming,
nor should it encourage or discourage you from subscribing.  My only
point is if you were planning on subscribing <i>anyway</i>, then
maybe you'd find that useful.  In case you're wondering, I'll probably
only get a t-shirt out of it.

<topic>Multimedia</topic>
<p />Has anyone ever said anything good about the DMCA?  Don't worry,
I won't be the first.

<p />Over the past 9 months Hidenori Takeshima single-handedly worked on
recreating the quartz.dll responsible for implementing ActiveMovie and 
DirectShow.  The codecs involved are a huge amount of code that's 
unfortunately questionable to distribute due to legal concerns.  Without
warning the code suddenly disappeared from both the X11 and the
GPL trees.  Questioned about why it was removed, Hidenori explained:

<quote who="Hidenori Takeshima">
<p />
My all MultiMedia codes are completely written from scratch.
 No disassembling. I believe there are no legal issues.
 But, I cannot warrant... I should protect myself from
 any potential problems now...
<p />
The main issues for me are
<ol>
 <li /> restrictions of EULA - some codes may be
  based on information from non-VS6.
  I don't want to battle with EULA.
 <li /> afraid to many pending patents.
  I cannot check all patents...
</ol>
and there are some other reasons I don't want to write...
<p />
So, finally, I decided to solicite Alexandre...
</quote>

<p />Andreas Mohr thanked Hidenori,
 <quote who="Andreas Mohr">
 I hope the reason for taking such rather drastic measures was important.

 Oh well, anyway, thanks for your contributions, Hidenori !
 (I'm just assuming there are still some left ;-)
</quote>

<p />Interesting trivia #2 - Hidenori is the first non-CodeWeavers 
person to expressly 
<a href="http://www.ping.uio.no/~ovehk/rewind/contrib-list.cgi">not allow</a> 
his code into the X11 tree.

<topic>Debugging</topic>	
<p />Andriy Palamarchuk put out a call to start using Bugzilla:
<quote who="Andriy Palamarchuk"><p />
We already had discussion on wine-devel about
importance of polishing Wine, making a set of
applications to work very well.
<p />
Cruicial in this process is prioritizing of the
issues, work distribution between developers. The
companies already have internal testing and bug fixing
process.
<p />
Of course, each company has their own product-specific
work, but most of the problems are general for Wine.
I suggest to share this work more actively using
Bugzilla.
<p />
Recently there was some work done in cleaning the
issues database and it is in pretty much usable
condition.
<p />
To start using bugzilla more actively I suggest
following steps:
<ol>
 <li /> define subsystem/direction owners. 
 <li />more formally define process of bugs handling and
       use this process
 <li />Prioritize bugs
 <li />Ask users to submit there problems in Bugzilla
</ol></quote> 

<p />Jeremy Newman went ahead and set up an easy URL
to remember that goes straight to Wine's Bugzilla:

<topic>Patches</topic>	
<p />Laurent Pinchart announced:
<quote who="Laurent Pinchart"><p />
 Here's (at last) the (long awaited ?) SafeDisc patch.
<p />
 I want to thank Zsolt Rizsanyi who helped me with the CDROM ioctls (his 
 implementation of IOCTL_SCSI_GET_ADDRESS has not been included in this patch, 
 as I don't have the latest version), Alexandre Juliard for his help with the 
 process suspension, Erich Pouech and Andreas Mohr for their help about how to 
 handle the reentrant wine server calls (even if that has turned out not to be 
 needed in the end), and all of those who answered my numerous questions on 
 #winehq. To the ones I forgot (if any), please forgive me. If you help me 
 with SafeDisc-1 I'll thank you twice :-)
<p />
 As I don't speak 'legalese', here's the usual disclaimer in nglish:
<p />
 This patch works on my system, and it will probably work for some of you. For 
 those who can't get it to work, I'm really sorry, and I'll help if you ask 
 nicely, but don't blame me or sue me.
</quote>

<p />
One caveat is the Wine needs to be run with <code>--winver nt40</code>
Laurent added, <quote who="Laurent Pinchart">
For those interrested, here's a FAQs about my SafeDisc support implementation.
Feel free to comment.
</quote>  The FAQs were attached to the email and can be found at:

<topic>Ports</topic>	
<p />
One item that doesn't get reported here much is the
work being done to port Wine to ReactOS.  Haven't heard
of ReactOS?  From their web page, <quote who="ReactOS">
 ReactOS is an Open Source effort to develop a 
 quality operating system that is compatible 
 with Windows NT applications and drivers. 
</quote>  Working on the Wine side of things are Steven
Edwards, Casper Hornstrup, and James Tabor.  
<p />Currently ReactOS works but the graphics interface
(GDI) is not functioning properly.  Win32 console apps
run and the OS is self-hosting using 
<a href="http://www.mingw.org">mingw</a>.  The plan is to
use Wine as the Win32 subsystem once DLL separation is
complete.  The main obstacles are:
<ul><li />Building the DLLs under Mingw 
    <li />DLL separation - ReactOS can't use internal
          wineserver functions
    <li />Interfacing ReactOS and the Wine debugger
</ul>

<p />One area of concern is getting
Wine to work with the mingw compiler.  Steven
Edwards had a question about why a patch he submitted for
ftruncate() was not applied and wondered why.  Alexandre
replied, <quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
 
 You'll either have to implement ftruncate in mingw, or change makedep
 to not require it. But making it silently broken is not a good idea.
</quote>

<p />Steven replied:
<quote who="Steven Edwards">
Ok. I got that from
<a href="http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/glib/glib-windows-compatability-functions.html">
http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/glib/glib-windows-compatability-functions.html</a>
and it works under mingw but I will try to find a better way of doing it
or just fix makedep.
</quote>

<p />Steven submitted another patch with the following changelog:
<quote who="Steven Edwards">
 Check for and use chsize instead of ftruncate if present.

 <quote who="Huw Davies">
 I think you have a buggy version of libXrender.so.  Could you check
 that this patch stops the crash?  Unfortunately it will disable client
 side font rendering.  Jeremy came up with a truly horrible hack to
 work around this problem but for some reason that I can't possibly
 imagine Alexandre left it out when he committed the last xrender

 That does fix it, though I was getting used to the client side fonts :(
 What version of XFree86 is needed to get a good xrender? I am running
 version 4.1.0.

<p />Jeremy White replied:
<quote who="Jeremy White"><p /> 
 You need 4.2.0.  You can also just build libXrender.so,
 which is not that hard to pull out of CVS and build by itself.
<p />
 Finally, I have attached the king daddy of all kludges that
 may let you use your Xrender without modification, but
 use at your own risk...  (you'll probably also need to
 hand assemble the patch, it's a delta from our internal
 tree and is not likely to apply).

<p />Jeremy's patch can be found at:

 http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-devel/2002/05/0053.html</a>
Mentioned in the patch is:
<quote who="Jeremy White"><p /><code>
        ** Xrender.c bug.  (Version 1.4 of Xrender.c had a bug where<br />
        ** an uninitialized stack variable could cause this to fail.<br />     
        ** This is fixed in version 1.5, which seems to correspond to <br />
        ** Xfree &gt;= 4.2<br />
        ** In the meantime, we do a total kludge to attempt to address this:<br />
        ** we call it twice, and pray that the second time it is<br />
        ** initialized (and nudge the stack while we're at it).  <br />
        ** If it doesn't, we just bail.
</code></quote>

<p />Duane still had problems with the patches, but then mentioned:
<quote who="Duane Clark"><p />
 In any case, I just downloaded the binary tar file:
 <a href="http://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.2.0/binaries/Linux-ix86-glibc22/Xbin.tgz">
 http://ftp.xfree86.org/pub/XFree86/4.2.0/binaries/Linux-ix86-glibc22/Xbin.tgz</a>
<p />
 and took out just the libXrender.so.1.1, and installed it. Everything 
 seems to work fine with that.

 Is it possible to use the native user32.dll? I know kernel and ws3_32

<p />This has actually worked in the past, but because of the address

<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
 I agree it would help for finding bugs. Unfortunately the Win95
 architecture is completely brain-damaged, and trying to support it
 would introduce so many new bugs and instabilities than the end result
 would be much worse than what we have today. So no, native user is not
 going to happen.
</quote>
<p />Ulrich Weigand explained in detail:
<quote who="Ulrich Weigand">
<p />
 Well, there's Windows and then there's Windows ;-)
<p />
 In Win9x, address spaces are handled in a peculiar way: the lower
 2 GB of the address space are changed on context switch, while the
 upper 2 GB remain the same across all processes. 
<p />
 In particular, all 16-bit segments and certain 32-bit DLLs are
 de facto mapped shared across all 32-bit processes.  The user.exe
 implementation relies on this fact, as I mentioned previously.
<p />
 Before address space separation, we were handling things somewhat
 like Win 3.1 (with win32s), in that everything shared one space.
 After address space separation, we are handling things more like
 Win NT, in that nothing is shared between processes by default,
 except for explicit shared mappings (and shared PE sections).
<p />
 In particular, 16-bit segments are not shared between processes
 (like they aren't in Win NT), which means that user.exe won't work.

 Implementing the weird Win9x address space handling exactly under
 Linux would be difficult, and in any case we *want* to be more 
 like Win NT for stability reasons ...

<p />Sylvain Petreolle was working on converting winhelp for NLS

I have to problems to use Va.rc,since I don't know

to the fact I was asleep in history &amp; geography :) ).
I looked in dlls/kernel/nls but didn't see it.</quote>

<p />Johan Gill thought it could be the Vatican, and 
Francois Gouget thought so too.  Eric Pouech was suspicious
of the naming,
<quote who="Eric Pouech">
 looking on google for some of the words used in the file seem to
 indicate that this is in fact "suisse roman" (romanche in English ?), perhaps 
 Alexandre could give an hint on this very important issue ;-))) 
 I don't think that Vatican guards being Swiss Guards is the explanation
 of the Va name
</quote>

<p />Alexandre supplied the answer:
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard"><p />
It's apparently "Rumantsch" (not sure about the English name) which is
the 4th Swiss national language (after German, French and Italian). It
is only spoken by perhaps a few thousand people in the eastern parts
of Switzerland. It should not be confused with "suisse roman" which is
the language spoken in the western part of Switzerland (where I'm
from), and which is basically French except for a few strange words
that make us sound funny when we go to France.
<p />
In Windows terms I think Rumantsch should be LANG_RHAETO_ROMANCE
(though this constant only appears in Wine headers so I'm not sure if
that's an official Windows definition). The file is named Va.rc
apparently because this is the "Vallader" variant of Rumantsch; there
are at least 5 variants according to
<a href="http://www.christusrex.org/www1/pater/JPN-rumantsch.html">
http://www.christusrex.org/www1/pater/JPN-rumantsch.html</a> (you sure
find strange things on google...). Don't ask me what are the
differences between the variants &lt;g&gt;

<p />It's funny how mentioning InstallShield provokes lively threads.
One of the last mentions of InstallShield lead to the call
for an LGPL'ed Wine tree.  This time Andriy Palamarchuk pointed out
<a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/">BugZilla</a> bug 
<a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=629">#629"</a> 
concerning InstallShield v6 support.  Ove K&#229;ven replied:
<quote who="Ove Kaaven"><p />
 Oh, well, it's a known problem. It's not easily fixable in the official
 Wine tree without, say, half a man-year of work. There's an ugly hack (an
 one-liner) to make it work (in conjunction with a stdole32.tlb file from
 real Windows), but since Alexandre never yet applied this hack to the
 official Wine (though it might be in CodeWeavers CrossOver), I presume he
 never will before there's a "real" solution (which will take man-months of
 work, and writing an IDL compiler to let us generate our own .tlb file
 instead of using the native one, maybe another month or two).
<p />
 After the WineX 2.0 release, I've once again been working on completing my
 version of the real solution (I'm close to have it working now), but of
 course, Gav probably still wants a fair chunk of LGPL-ed code relicensed
 in exchange...
</quote>

<p />Several people wondered what the "ugly hack" was to make it work.
Marcus Meissner, author of the out of process COM code in the LGPL'ed 
Wine tree replied with a patch you can find at:
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-devel/2002/05/0171.html">
http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-devel/2002/05/0171.html</a>

<p />Alexandre thought the COM code was going to be exchanged with the
ALSA driver.  However, Eric Pouech did the development of the ALSA stuff
and he clarified his position by stating:
<quote who="Eric Pouech"><p />
When I decided starting coding the ALSA driver, TG offered to sponsor
the work. I turned down the offer (don't need sponsor for what I'm doing)
and suggested using the money for some other use.
Furthermore, I'm not for or against Wine nor for or against WineX. I'm
just trying not to let an important gap being created between all the
different projects.
<p />
The ALSA driver has been started on a X11/MIT license, some people
currently are giving an hand to shape it better (David Hammerton did some testing and
bug fixing for 0.5, Marco Pietrobono is currently fighting with the awes of
the 0.9 interface, but that's another story), and will remain under the
X11/MIT license.
</quote>

<p />Ove replied to Alexandre's original inquiry about trading patches 
with, 
<quote who="Ove Kaaven">
 What is most important for TransGaming now, is to see the DLL separation
 work get into ReWind. He's making a list of things to trade it with, such
 as a DIB drawing engine, fast DIB sections using ShmPixmaps, this COM
 stuff I'm working on, and of course various DirectX things. Since I've
 researched and worked on this COM thing (with undocumented stuff all over)
 for months, I doubt TransGaming would settle with just an ALSA driver, now
 that their development costs have increased from the forking.
</quote>

<p />The thread turned rather ugly at points, with Alexandre and Jeremy 
White both stating that they're not interested in the patch trading business.  
Everyone agrees that the code should be publicly available, but the licensing 
was once again the divisive point.  Gavriel State jumped in to mention:
<quote who="Gavriel State">
<p />
What we are proposing is not "blackmail" but *trade*.
<p />
Really, the economic problem in this licensing situation comes down to a
question of accounting (most economic problems do).  What value do you place
on a contribution to the project, whether it is your own or someone else's?
<p />
The LGPL license that Wine is currently using is effectively saying that
the value of your current contribution is equal to the expected value
of any future contributions.  IE: All contributions and contributors,
current and future are equivalent.  Certainly this simplifies the accounting,
but at a serious loss in accuracy.
<p />
As we've already stated, TransGaming can't operate within that framework,
for a wide variety of reasons.  Instead, we're going to be making the
value picture more specific.  We would like access to some code that's
currently licensed under the LGPL by copyright holders like yourself and
CodeWeavers.  In particular, we would like to see address space separation
work made available under the X11/ReWind license.  That would be a boon
for everyone, as it would allow easy interchangability between Wine and
ReWind (and WineX) DLLs.  There are a few other things that would be
nice as well.
<p />
In exchange, we have a number of things that we would be happy to contribute
to ReWind, and thus to the Wine tree.  These things include our new DIB engine
work, COM/DCOM work, selected portions of our work on copy protection, and a
number of other significant features.  We're also quite happy to work on any
DLLs that need additional separation work.
<p />
What has to get figured out is simply this: exactly what do current Wine
copyright holders want to have for the things that we want from you?
<p />
I'd like to resolve this question soon, and establish some kind of ongoing
framework for how to manage this cooperation in the future.  I hope to
have a detailed proposal for the Wine LGPL-only contributors shortly.
</quote>

<p />Alexandre came up with analogy in reply:
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard"><p />
 The problem is that you are seeing this in economic terms. That's not
 how it works. The real value is not in the individual contributions,
 it's in the collaboration, where everybody works with everybody else
 on building the best possible Windows emulator.
<p />
 Consider you are organizing a party with your friends: someone who has
 a large music collection will bring his CDs, some will cook something,
 others will spend time decorating the room, etc.  What value do you
 place on each contribution?  How many cakes do I have to bring to be
 allowed to listen to the music?  That's not how it works. Everybody
 helps according to his time and ability, and then we all enjoy the
 party.
<p />
 What you are doing is you come to the party, you eat and drink from
 what others have brought, but when people want some of your stuff you
 charge them for it. And when they complain you ask them to start
 charging for their stuff too, and transform the party into a shopping
 mall. Sorry, but for me that would take all the fun out of it.
<p />
 If you want to join the party you are expected to participate
 according to your abilities. And yes, with your full-time programmers
 you can (and should) contribute more than people who just have a few
 hours a month to spend on it. That doesn't mean you are somehow
 entitled to get more fun out of the party than they do.
<p />
 So far we have welcomed you to the party, even though you contributed
 much less than you could have; but the problem is that you are
 actually preventing others from enjoying the party, and this can't go
 on. So you can either start participating and sharing like everybody
 else, or you can stay home and cook your own dinner. But if you want
 to eat some of what I've brought, the only way is to join the party.

Karel Bosschaart mentioned that he got CrossOver Office to work
with FreeBSD:
<quote who="Karel Bosschaart"><p />
FWIW, I installed the linux version under emulation in FreeBSD and made
a little write-up of my experience:
<p />
<a href="http://wop21.wop.wtb.tue.nl/cxoffice">
 http://wop21.wop.wtb.tue.nl/cxoffice</a>
<p />
Except for the flood of unimplemented ioctl's messages it runs quite OK,
but of course I'm looking forward to the FreeBSD version.
<p />
I'll add more of my experiences while using CrossOver Office.
</quote>

<p />Karel mentions he tested FreeBSD 4.5-R, 4.5-S, and 5.0-DP1 with linux_base 6.
Francois Gouget was pleasantly surprised it worked, but concerned about the ioctl's 
performance impact.
