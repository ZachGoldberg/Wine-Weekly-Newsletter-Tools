<p />

This is the 54th release of the Wine's kernel cousin
publication. Its main goal is to distribute widely what's
going on around Wine (the Un*x Windows emulator).

Aric Stewart posted a patch implementing the InternetCheckConnection() 
API. This function checks whether an Internet connection is
available.

<p />

Marcus Meissner didn't like the implementation (it was using a ping to a
certain address): 
<quote who="Marcus Meissner">
This can be considered a denail of service attack. Imagine an
application doing:<br />
<code>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;TryFireUpDialin();<br />
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;while (!InternetCheckConnection());
</code><br />
Not good. Also even without a ping getting through we can still access 
URLs if behind a firewall.

<p />

We should probably just check if we have a network connection at all.
</quote>
.
Marcus suggested either parsing the output of 'ifconfig' checking for
ppp or eth interfaces, or looking at 'route -n' for those interfaces.

<p />

Bertho Stultiens proposed to use 'netstat -r -n' to get the correct
interfaces.

<p />

St&#233;phane Lussier pointed out that Microsoft's documentation says that
when FLAG_ICC_FORCE_CONNECTION flag is set, the function shall try the URL.
http://msdn.microsoft.com/workshop/networking/wininet/reference/functions/InternetCheckConnection.asp

<p />

Then part of the discussion covered the portability issues: Gerald
Pfeifer noted that, for example, the route command had a different
location under Solaris or FreeBSD, some different command line
switches than the Linux ones, and also some stricter privilege
checking (only root can list route tables).

<p />

But, after some investigation, 'netstat -r -n' seemed to be portable,
and working with user privileges on most unices.

<p />

Alexandre Julliard proposed another approach:<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
Having to parse the output of netstat will be more trouble than it's
worth IMO. I think we should not try to be too clever here. I'd
suggest simply checking for a network interface that is up and not
loopback, using the same ioctls than ifconfig does.</quote>

<p />

Both options seem acceptable, but no implementation has been provided
yet. </section>

Jeff Tranter from Corel announced:
<quote who="Jeff Tranter">
As part of our WINE development we created a performance
profiler tool that supports multi-threaded programs (GNU
gprof does not support threads). We've just released it
under the GPL and made it available from our open source
web site. You can find more information on the tool at

James Abbatiello gave a try, but run into multiple errors and had to
do lots of work by hand, but without any success. It seems that until
CVS trees from Corel and WineHQ are properly synchronized, this nice
tool shall be hard to tame.</section>
