Jeremy White put out for comment an RFC covering the Wine
documentation aspects. This follows the first steps already made (see
<kcref issuenum="49" sectionnum="2">previous issue</kcref>). Jeremy wrote:

<quote who="Jeremy White">
As part of the Wine 1.0 effort, we've been working on improving the
Wine documentation. 

<p />

We have a proposal for a way to overhaul the documentation system,
and we'd like some feedback.

<p />

We start with the following goals:
<ol>
	<li>Documentation should be easy to find</li>
	<li>Documentation should be clear (the user should quickly see 
        the thing that he or she wants, and there should be no confusion
        as to which document is 'right')</li>
	<li>Documentation should be consistent (the documentation should
        look the same whether it is on winehq or on a mirror, or in
        a tarball).</li>
	<li>Documentation should be easy to change.</li>
</ol>

<p />

We propose the following visible changes:
<ol>
	<li>Entry documentation page should be simplified
        and prioritized</li>
	<li>Many multiple disconnected (but similar and/or redundant)
        documents should be merged under a consistent format.</li>
	<li>Centralize all of the documentation under one CVS point,
        possibly as a new CVS tree, possibly just as the
        documentation/ branch of the Wine CVS tree.</li>
	<li>Switch the FAQ to use a FAQ-O-MATIC, to facilitate
        updates and changes to it, and to allow the creation of a 
        world editable late breaking bugs section.</li>
</ol>

Jeremy then provided a link to such an experimental 
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/?page=documentation">page</a>

<p />

Then, Jeremy proposed some changes in the way documentation is
handled; basically, he was keen on having a separate CVS tree
dedicated to documentation. Alexandre Julliard strongly preferred to
keep the source and documentation trees together, so that changes to
the code are reflected to the documentation. 

<p />

Dimitrie O. Paun even suggested to move documentation related to a
given DLL into a specific subdirectory of the DLL source. Dimi felt
this had several advantages:
<ul>
	<li>greater probability of having the docs maintained</li>
	<li>easier for people to get into the project</li>
	<li>possibility to maintain the dll separately</li>
</ul>

<p />

No final agreement seems to have been reached.</section>

James Hatheway ran into some networking issues:

<quote who="James Hatheway">
The app that I am debugging from time to time sends broadcast
(255.255.255.255) UDP packets using the winsock function sendto(). On
Windows, if the default gateway is not configured, the sendto()
function still sends the UDP packet onto the local network. In Linux,
if no default gateway is set, sendto() fails with a "network
unreachable". Since it is possible to have an isolated local network
that isn't connected to the internet, I guess it is possible to not
have a gateway configured, so I want to fix  WSOCK32_sendto() to be
like Windows and handle this.
</quote>


<p />

Alexandre Julliard didn't like the proposed fix, and rather suggested to
report an explicit error to the user, asking him/her <editorialize>I do
need to be politically correct</editorialize> to add an explicit route from
255.255.255.255 to the local network.</section>

<p />

It's still an early beta version, so all your comments are welcomed.
This is the first implementation of the tool defined earlier on (read
<kcref issuenum="52" sectionnum="1">previous issue</kcref> for the details).</section>

Douglas Ridgway announced:

<quote who="Doug Ridgway">
CodeWeavers has been kind enough to set up a new bug tracking system
for Wine using Bugzilla. This will replace the old system. You can see
a preview at <a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/">
http://bugs.winehq.org/</a>, which is supposed to be
fully live and the official bug database by the end of this week.

<p />

The old system is currently only accessible at
http://ursula.gmcl.com/Bugs/ and has 500+ existing reports. I can't 
guarantee that this system will remain accessible beyond the end of 
the week. It might be worthwhile trying to make sure that important 
reports are copied into the new system before they are lost / made inaccessible.

<p />

A big thank you to CodeWeavers for setting up and maintaining this new 
system. Good bug tracking is a crucial part of making Wine great, and
this system promises to be a significant improvement over what it's
replacing.

Even if it's not fully operational yet, you can still have a look at it.</section>
