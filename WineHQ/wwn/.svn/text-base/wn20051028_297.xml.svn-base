<issue num="297" date="10/28/2005" />
<intro> <p>This is the 297th issue of the Wine Weekly News publication.
Its main goal is to celebrate a beta release! It also serves to inform you of what's going on around Wine. Wine is an open source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.  Think of it as a Windows compatibility layer.  Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely alternative implementation consisting of 100% Microsoft-free code, but it can optionally use native system DLLs if they are available.   You can find more info at <a href="http://www.winehq.org">www.winehq.org</a></p> </intro>

	title="News: Beta Release, CrossOver Office 5.0"
	subject="News"
	archive="http://www.winehq.org/site/pr-09betarelease"
	posts="4"

<topic>News</topic>
<p>Do we really need to say what the headline is this week?  Wait for it.. 
wait for it..
</p><ul><ul><ul><b>Beta!</b></ul></ul></ul>
<p>In the past, Wine releases followed a standard format.  About every
month Alexandre would release a CVS snapshot with the format of YYYYMMDD,
such as wine-20050930.  Those CVS snapshots were just that: a point in
time where everything in CVS was tagged.  Often those releases saw the
bare minimum of testing, such as running the Wine test suite against it.
</p><p>
We're in different territory now.  The beta release saw quite a few people
hammer on it for almost a month before it was released.  Bugs in Bugzilla
were tracked, reviewed, and fixed.  
</p><p>
Here's Alexandre announcement:</p>
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard"><p>
This is release 0.9 of Wine, a free implementation of Windows on Unix.
After 12 years of development, this release marks the beginning of the
beta testing phase.  Everybody is encouraged to try it; while there
are still bugs, most applications are expected to at least install and
do something useful.
</p><p>
Because of lags created by using mirrors, this message may reach you
before the release is available at the ftp sites.  The sources will be
available from the following locations:
<ul>
  <a href="http://ibiblio.org/pub/linux/system/emulators/wine/wine-0.9.tar.bz2">http://ibiblio.org/pub/linux/system/emulators/wine/wine-0.9.tar.bz2</a><br />
  <a href="http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wine/wine-0.9.tar.bz2">http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/wine/wine-0.9.tar.bz2</a>
</ul></p><p>
Binary packages for various distributions will be available from:
<ul>
  <a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/download">http://www.winehq.org/site/download</a>
</ul></p><p>
You will find documentation on <a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/documentation.">http://www.winehq.org/site/documentation.</a>
</p><p>
You can also get the current source directly from the CVS tree. Check
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/cvs">http://www.winehq.org/cvs</a> for details.
</p><p>
Patches should be submitted to &quot;<a href='mailto:wine-patches@winehq.org'>wine-patches@winehq.org</a>&quot;.  Please
don't forget to include a ChangeLog entry. If you submitted a patch,
please check to make sure it has been included in the new release.
</p><p>
Wine is available thanks to the work of many people. See the file
AUTHORS in the distribution for the complete list.
</p></quote>

<p>That AUTHORS file, by the way, was updated for this release and now
contains 797 individuals.</p>

<p>We had an official 
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/pr-09betarelease">press release</a> about
it.  It's nice, light reading.  I also put together a special edition of WWN,
<a href="http://www.winehq.com/?issue=296">#296</a>, to look at more of
the technical background behind Wine 0.9.  We've been on the verge of a 
beta release for a number of years and it seems like there's been some
rather amorphous goals that were set to reach it.  Well, we actually have
a pretty good record of the major projects tackled over the past six years so
I took a look back and summarized what some of the critical ones for the
beta release were.  </p><p>

In other big news, CodeWeavers released CrossOver Office 5.0 on the same day.  
There's definitely a lot of new stuff under the hood with this release;
a lot of which can be found in Wine 0.9.  As usual, Jeremy White's
<a href="http://crossover.codeweavers.com/pipermail/announce/2005-October/000030.html">announcement</a>
is more interesting reading than the official 
<a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/about/general/press/?id=20051025">press 
release</a>.  Outside of things like the window manager rewrite and other
technical things, the big news here is Microsoft Office 2003 support.
You can also find a new thing, 
<a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxoffice/bottles/"><i>bottles</i></a>, 
that let you install applications into their own virtual Windows drive.  Each 
bottle can contain its own custom configuration.  Then you can package it up 
into an RPM for installation elsewhere.   
</p><p>
Go <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/store/?cat=cxof">buy it</a> now and
give yourself the warm, fuzzy feeling of supporting free software development.
</p><p>
The media picked up on both of these items and over the next few weeks
we'll definitely track that.  Here's some of the ones I happened to notice
this week (let me know if you see more):

One topic appearing on a lot of the discussion forums was what exactly a
beta release means since a lot of people have been using Wine for a long
time.  Well, my $.02 is that we're no longer planning any big projects that
will steal your lunch money.  In the past we had things on the to-do list
like "window management rewrite".  Well, we knew that would break a lot
of things.  We don't really have anything like that on the list now.  Sure,
there's going to be some huge additions to individual DLLs that will 
certainly cause regressions, but hopefully those can just be worked out.</p>

<topic>Project Management</topic>
<p>After 0.9 was released, the floodgates opened and lots of patches
poured in.  Notable additions included a ton of MSI improvements by
Mike McCormack, more crypt32 work by Juan Lang, and oleaut32 additions
from Alex Villac&#237;s Lasso.  You can expect a lot of additions in
the near future as developers complete patches they've been working
on during the past few weeks of freeze.</p><p>  

While the core internals of Wine are
now complete, there remains a lot of work fleshing out various DLLs.
In the course of discussion, Alexandre mentioned some of the things
that need to get fixed before 1.0:</p>
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard"><p>
we still have a lot of work to
do on usability issues (winecfg, desktop mode, cdrom support, systray,
etc.), and we need better support for the various code obfuscation
tools, it's probably the number one cause of apps not even starting
today.</p></quote>

<p>Jonathan Wilson asked if that last item meant support for Safedisc,
Securom and other copy protection methods. Alexandre replied,
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
As far as possible, yes. I think the goal for 1.0 should be that
anybody has to be able to try Wine and see that it's for real. This
means they must not be stopped either by not being able to configure
it, or by apps failing to even start.</quote>
</p>
<p>In case you missed it, that's our roadmap for the next few months.</p>

<topic>Configuration</topic>
<p>Someone ran into a problem using winecfg's drive configuration:</p>
<quote who="wino@piments.com"><p>

just getting into a fresh installation with 0.9
</p><p>
ran up winecfg and tried to add a device for my dvd burner.
</p><p>
editing the device name is unusable. No cursor, then after a first
character is entered the edit seems to jump to insert mode and puts the
cursor at the beginning of the line. There seems to be no way enter text normally
to enter a device name.
</p><p>
This whole interface seems badly broken. I had to fall back to good old
command line to sort out the mess made by winecfg and add the devices I
need.
</p></quote>

<p>Someone else also noticed it and provided the workaround:</p>
<quote who="wine@eternaldusk.com"><p>
I noticed this as well last night when I was testing some Windows
programs for compatibility.  I'm glad Wino mentioned it here, because I
almost forgot.
</p><p>
I went into the dosdevices directory and set up the links manually,
because it's real hard to get non-fubar'd results with winecfg.</p></quote>

<p>Vitaliy Margolen suggested just using the <i>Browse</i> button since it

	title="Bugzilla: Closing Bugs"
	subject="Thank you for closing my bugzilla account..."
	archive="http://www.winehq.com/pipermail/wine-devel/2005-October/.html"
	posts="11"
>
<topic>Project Management</topic>
<p>Digging through Wine's <a href="http://bugs.winehq.org">Bugzilla</a>
tracker can be good way to learn things about Wine.  Whether that's 
confirming an unconfirmed bug, finding something small to fix, or
simply getting a feel for what areas need to be worked on.  
</p><p>
Jonathan Ernst has been wrangling bugs for a few weeks now and was
surprised when someone suspended his Bugzilla account:</p>
<quote who="Jonathan Ernst"><p>
It was then discussed that bugs that are FIXED and where resolution is
not LATER or DUPLICATE or REMIND should be marked CLOSED as the fixes
have been integrated in an official release (namely 0.9).</p><p>
However it seems that ivanleo didn't like my CLOSING session because
some of the bugs were not "fixed". Can someone tell me how a bug can be
not fixed and marked as resolved-fixed (see my query) ?

</p></quote>

<p>Well, that seems to make sense.  It's hard to think of a reason to
have a ton of active bugs marked as fixed but not closed.  That launched a 
bigger discussion about when and how bugs should
get closed.  Ivan Leo Puoti, who suspended Jonathan's account, then
apologized for doing so but explained he did it because it wasn't
clear any of the FIXED bugs had been verified.  Well, that's rather
hard with any free software project where there's no dedicated staff
for QA work.  (As opposed to free software projects that do have dedicated
staff.)   Dimi Paun thought some of the QA steps that would normally be
separated should simply be considered combined together: </p>
<quote who="Dimi Paun"><p>


First, it is the responsibility of the reporter to verify the bug.
It is totally unrealistic to think that others will go do the 
verification -- they lack the software, the context, and the motivation/
</p><p>
Second, we had close to a thousand bugs in that state. They do more
harm than good lingering about. If the original reporter cannot be
bothered to verify it, they should be closed.</p></quote>


<p>Vijay Kiram Kamuju thought another problem was Bugzilla itself made the 
issue confusing,
<quote who="Vijay Kiram Kamuju">
there was misunderstanding
regarding the bug status,  ie, RESOLVED LATER, RESOLVED CLOSED,
VERIFIED, etc.
It would be better if we could put some details regarding the bug
status on the bugzilla or FAQ pages, as there are some differences in
the explanation of these.
I am used to a different bug management app (ClearDDTS) where there
are only 4-5 states a bug can
have. (NEW,ASSIGNED,OPEN,RESOLVED,VERIFIED)</quote>
</p>
<p>Jonathan gave a link to an explanation of 
<a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/bug_status.html">bug statuses</a>.  </p>

<p>The end result of the discussion was Jonathan got his account restored and 
a bunch of FIXED bugs were officially CLOSED.</p>

<topic>Ports</topic>
<p>Robert Lunnon began posting a series of patches to get Solaris x86
back on track.  Wine strives to be portable to as many architectures
as possible, but most of the developers use Linux.  As a result a lot
of things sneak in that cause problems on other architectures.  
Fortunately folks like Robert take the time to work out those bugs.
He described his series of patches on wine-devel:</p>
<quote who="Robert Lunnon"><p>
I have posted my local patches to wine-patches.
</p><p>
Note that for 0.9 I have posted most of the patches that are likely to be
essential to build a working Wine package (other than those previously
rejected) regardless of the shape the code is in. Some of it is very ugly and
lacks integration for other OSen, I have noted these. Since this code is
maintained as a delta from CVS wine specific to Solaris and only used for
binary packages, it's not necessary to start out with the niceties all there
(This particularly happens when I get deep into week long debugging
sessions).
</p><p>
Patches not sent are listed hereunder along with the reasons...
</p><p>


<u>Possibly essential (Show stoppers)</u>
</p><p>
ptrace stub patch 
<ul> Disable debugger by returning error for all ptrace calls,
add  ptrace stubs (framework) to allow work on ptrace emulation layer for
wine. -Previously rejected
</ul></p><p>
linking patch 
<ul>since libwinecrt0.a was added wine has been broken due to the
linker wanting to import main() in dlls, this results in unresolved symbols.
I have temporarily worked around this and can build wine with a change to
winegcc that links another archive (I call winedllcrt0.a) which omits the
main() definitions in the case where -shared is passed to winegcc. Alexandre
has asked that I keep looking for a way to make the Solaris linker
successfully link an archive containing main() to dlls without the need to
have two runtime startoff libraries.  Patch won't be submitted until a final
solution is found.
</ul></p><p>

<u>Recommended functionality patches</u>
</p><p>
cpuid patch 
<ul>CPUID detection using x86 cpuid instruction - previously
rejected</ul>
</p><p>
wineconsole/curses.c 
<ul> Patch non-essential and FAR too hacky at this point -
just removes all mouse code.</ul>
</p><p>
<u>Other Patches</u>
</p><p>
tools 
<ul>automation patches to allow unattended build No interest to Wine
project</ul>
</p><p>
Debugger 
<ul>work in progress, not working</ul>
</p><p>

<p>A few months ago Dragon Naturally Speaking was a hot topic on wine-devel.
It seems version 8 doesn't really work with Wine, but version 7 can be
coaxed into running.  Someone (no name given) provided the recipe this
week for making it work:</p>
<quote who="wino_at_piments.com"><p>
OK, I think I've cracked it.
</p><p>
After a lot of heaving and grunting I managed to reinstall Dragon  
Naturally Speaking into a fresh user account with the help of sidenet.
</p><p>
This time I carefully documented the steps I took so as to be sure it was  
reproducible.
</p><p>
What worked:
<ul>
wine-20050524; sidenet-1.8.1; Dragon NS v7 preferred En. and v7 pref Fr
Ensoniq 1371 pci "soundblaster"</ul>
</p><p>
What won't:
<ul>
winecfg based wine releases ; more recent sidenet on previous above wine.
muse5.1 cmipci (too quiet)</ul>
</p><p>
Required natives: 
<ul>comdlg32.dll only</ul>
</p><p>
That it in a nutshell , here's the log:

OK exits cleanly.
</li>
<li>find comdlg32.dll and put in system.</li>

<li><code>$ wine natspeak</code><br /> 
enter user general training.</li>

<li>NS cannot control the volume level although it thinks it does.<br />
use alsamixer or similar to ensure capture is on MIK and capture level  
around 80% (YMMV)<br />

84 vol gives 22 quality rating but message says too high, basic training  
sticky.<br />
req reduce vol to 82: fine
</li></ol>
</p><p>
Able to complete general training and begin dictation into DragonPad.
Excellent results.

<p>The topic of using Wine to support various hardware drivers comes
up quite a bit.  In general, the recommendation is to develop a real
Linux driver.  This week Claude Mench came up with an interesting
idea regarding graphics drivers:</p>
<quote who="Claude Mench"><p>
 I rencently read a whole lot of MSDN documentation about the LDDM
infrastructure. The new Windows graphics vista driver model.
<ul>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/Display_d/hh/Display_d/DisplayDriverModel_Guide_c96d975e-dcc9-49b5-be73-b4d8b9f06eb8.xml.asp">

DisplayDriverModel_Guide_c96d975e-dcc9-49b5-be73-b4d8b9f06eb8.xml.asp</a></ul>
</p><p>
And what made me think we could have support for it in linux.
<ul>
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/Display_d/hh/Display_d/DisplayDriverModel_Guide_c96d975e-dcc9-49b5-be73-b4d8b9f06eb8.xml.asp">

</p><p>
It seem to me that having the most important parts of the driver
being in user mode would really help to use it on other systems.
</p><p>
From what I read, the user mode driver would create the command
buffer that would need to be uploaded to the GPU and a kernel
module would need to schedule GPU access handle memory of the
GPU and send the command buffer to it.
</p><p>
This would need the Wine Expertise of DirectX reimplementation as
well as some good kernel hacker, but in the end maybe the struggle
to have linux specific support from Graphics adapter vendors could
be once and for all removed if we had LDDM driver support and then
X build on top of it (same philosophy as Xgl).
</p><p>
it could also benefit to the wine project itself as we would have
really windows driver being used, it should help increase
compatibility.
</p><p>
sorry if it sounds crazy... </p></quote>

<p>Well, that's not as crazy as a it seems.  The new graphics
model in Windows Vista will be completely different than any
other version of Windows.  Microsoft has a nice, concise 
description on MSDN:</p>
<quote who="Microsoft"><p>
The display driver model architecture for Microsoft Windows codename 
"Longhorn" is composed of user-mode and kernel-mode parts. The 
following figure shows the architecture required to support the 
Windows Longhorn display driver model. A graphics hardware vendor 
must supply the user-mode display driver and the display miniport 
driver. The user-mode display driver is a dynamic-link library (DLL) 
that is loaded by the Microsoft Direct3D runtime. The display 
miniport driver communicates with the Microsoft DirectX graphics 
kernel subsystem. For more information about the user-mode display 
driver and display miniport driver, see the Windows Codename 
Longhorn Display Driver Model Reference.</p></quote>

<p>That's a pretty significant change: Direct3D being at the heart
of the display.  Reaction was mixed on wine-devel.  Stefan D&#246;singer
was against the idea while Krzysztof Foltman was for it.  From there
the idea sort of died off.</p>
