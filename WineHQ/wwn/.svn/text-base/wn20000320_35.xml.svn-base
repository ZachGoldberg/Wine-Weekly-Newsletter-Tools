This is the 35th release of the Wine's kernel cousin

going on around Wine (the Un*x Windows emulator).

<section 
  title="XFree86 and Wine"
  subject="Wine problem with XFree 4.0"
  archive="http://www.integrita.com/cgi-local/lwgate.pl/WINE-DEVEL/archives/2000-03/Subject/article-241.html"
>

<p />

Lionel Ulmer reported some serious problems running Wine with XFree86
4.0. This is because XFree86 4.0 includes OpenGL and other extensions
that depends on the standard threading system (normally pthreads),
while Wine implements its own threading system to mimic Win32's.

<p />

Before a reasonable fix is found, several (more or less nasty)
workarounds are available:
<ul>
   <li />You may want to apply Ove's updated 
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/unoff/">unofficial pthread hack</a> to
see if it helps the situation. (Previous discussions of this hack and
why it is not in the official Wine releases can be found 
<a href="wn19990718_4.html#1">here</a> and 
<a href="wn19990914_8.html#3">here</a>) 
   <li />disable OpenGL support in Wine (at compilation time)
   <li />wait before upgrading to XFree86 (ok, that's not a decent
long term proposal, but before a fix is applied, it may be the easiest 
one)
</ul>

  title="Socket bug hunt"
  subject="Help on winsock problem..."

<p />

Matthew Cline reported some socket connections issues with Real Player 
7. He investigated a bit the issue, and it turned out that the server
was confused by receiving two simultaneous events (some data are to be 
read, and the connection has been closed), and wasn't reporting all
the information (and the data) back to the application.

<p />

Ove K&#229;ven promptly proposed a fix, but was unsure of the utter
correctness of it. Alexandre Julliard confirmed that it was the way to 
go, even if the implementation details remained to be revisited
(mostly by changing a bit the socket handling).

<p />

Ove, Alexandre and Alex Korobka discussed then further the implementation.</section>

  title="Another Wine CVS mirror"
  subject="Announce: CVS mirror"

<p />

Andreas Mohr announced that he put up another CVS mirror for the Wine
tree.<br /><code>
CVSROOT=:pserver:cvs@rhlx01.fht-esslingen.de:/home/wine<br /></code>
and password is cvs.

<p />

Andreas also added that users shouldn't been annoyed by the harmless<br />
<code>
cvs server: cannot open /root/.cvsignore: Permission denied</code><br />
message: <quote who="Andreas Mohr">Many CVS servers have this problem and nobody
seems to know how to prevent the server from accessing
/root/.cvsignore. </quote></section>
