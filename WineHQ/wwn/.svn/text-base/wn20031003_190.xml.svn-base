<issue num="190" date="10/03/2003" />
<intro> <p>This is the 190th issue of the Wine Weekly News publication.
Its main goal is to recover from last night's bachelor party. It also serves to inform you of what's going on around Wine. Wine is an open source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.  Think of it as a Windows compatibility layer.  Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely alternative implementation consisting of 100% Microsoft-free code, but it can optionally use native system DLLs if they are available.

<topic>Project Management</topic>
<p>Earlier this year some threads appeared on wine-devel about holding
a conference to gather Wine developers (see 
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/?issue=156#Wineconf%202003?">issue #156</a>
for details.)  Jeremy White of CodeWeavers brought it up again this week
in an email with the subject "Wineconf 2004, otherwise known as...":</p>
<quote who="Jeremy White"><p>
...making good on my threat.
</p><p>
We are making plans to host Wineconf 2004,
in St. Paul, MN, during January 2004.
</p><p>
This is the last chance for someone in Europe to volunteer
to organize it in their neck of the woods...
</p><p>
Otherwise, we plan to provide:
<ul>
  <li> A meeting space for 2 days</li>
  <li> Arrangements for moderately price hotel rooms</li>
  <li> Advice on transportation, which should be straightforward</li>
  <li> A meal or two, and drinks for at least one evening</li>
  <li> We'll have all CodeWeavers Wine hackers in town for the event</li>
  <li> Free buttons for  the St. Paul Winter Carnival:<ul>
       <a href="http://www.winter-carnival.com/">
       http://www.winter-carnival.com/</a></ul>
    &lt;grin&gt;</li></ul>
 </p><p> 
What we will expect you to provide:
<ul>
  <li> Your airfare (sorry, no IPO money for us)</li> 
  <li> Your hotel room</li> 
  <li> A laptop with wireless</li> 
  <li> Long underwear and Parkas</li> </ul>
</p><p>
What I don't know yet:
<ul>
  <li> We may need to charge some sort of modest fee,
    depending on how the budget and our bank account
    look.  We're willing to shoulder some costs,
    but we may need extra help.  We'll also plan on 
    using the Wine party fund to help cover some costs.</li>
  <li> Exact dates; my thinking is to do it in conjunction
    with a weekend (e.g.  Fri/Sat or Sun/Mon), but
    I want to see what meeting space cost/availability
    looks like before I pick.  Right now, Fri Jan 16th/
    Sat Jan 17th are looking good (note that LinuxWorld NY
    is the following week for those that might be able
    to get their employer to sponsor the trip Stateside).</li></ul>
</p><p>

Thoughts?  Comments?  
</p><p>
If you think you would come, please email me privately;
I'd like to get a rough count to help with planning.

<p>Several people wrote back with most of the discussion centered
around location.  Lots of folks wanted a conference in Europe but
finding someone to organize seemed to be the stumbling point.  
Jakob Eriksson did offer his living room, but it seemed to be eclipsed
by a more serious offer of Sorrento, Italy.  </p>

<topic>Testing</topic>
<p>Jakob Eriksson succeeded in compiling Wine's test programs and his
testing framework with Visual C++ (covered in part 
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/?issue=189#New%20Tests%20For%20Windows">in
issue #189</a>): </p><quote who="Jakob Eriksson"><p>
winetests.exe with tests from CVS 2003-09-26 can be found here:
<ul>
<a href="http://vmlinux.org/~jakov/Wine/">http://vmlinux.org/~jakov/Wine/</a>
</ul></p><p>
(The bigger EXE size is due to tests generated from MSVC instead of MinGW.)
</p><p>
This winetests.exe should not pop up various error requesters any more,
so if you click past any, please note it in the comment text box.
</p></quote>

<p>Ferenc Wagner wondered how different error conditions were handled and
had some suggestion for changing the output. </p>

<topic>Ports</topic>
<p>I'm filing this thread under the topic "Ports", which is rather odd.
Originally this thread started about a week ago when Ivan Leo Murray-Smith 
dropped a note discussing some work he'd done:</p>
<quote who="Ivan Leo Murray-Smith"><p>
Hello!
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-devel/2003/09/att-0847/01-mkwine">The attached script</a> makes it possible to compile many programs from Wine
under Windows.  The only software needed on Windows is Cygwin with MinGW
libraries and some other utilities (flex, bison).  Simply run setup.exe
from www.cygwin.com and make sure to select MinGW development tools.
Then get Wine sources, and run the attached script in the Cygwin shell
while in the Wine top-level source directory.
</p><p>
There is one minor fix that needs to be applied to the sources to fix
compatibility with MinGW headers (run autoconf and autoheader after
applying):
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-patches/2003/09/att-0347/01-spawnvp.diff">
http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-patches/2003/09/att-0347/01-spawnvp.diff</a>
</p><p>
The configure script is rather slow in Cygwin, so it's instructed not to
create makefiles, only config.h.  Then the necessary libraries are
compiled.  The next step is to link wrc, the Wine resource compiler.
</p><p>
Once wrc is ready, the script starts compiling programs.  I cannot get
windres to compile most Wine's resources directly, so there are compiled
from *.rc to *.res by wrc and then from *.res to *.o by windres.
</p><p>
Programs currently compiled by the script:
<ul><li> clock.exe
</li><li>cmdlgtst.exe
</li><li>notepad.exe
</li><li>progman.exe
</li><li>regedit.exe
</li><li>start.exe
</li><li>view.exe
</li><li>wcmd.exe
</li><li>winefile.exe
</li><li>winemine.exe
</li><li>winhelp.exe
</li><li>winver.exe</li></ul></p><p>
Yes, you can play winemine on Windows now ;-)
</p></quote>

<p>This brought forth a slew of comments about supporting the
compilation directly out of Wine's makefiles.  This week Ivan posted
another note letting everyone know the binaries are available for
download,
<quote who="Ivan Leo Murray-Smith">
Patches and scripts are useless for most users, and cygwin isn't software you
install quickly with a analog modem, so I've uploaded a build of the wine
programs for windows on our sourceforge page.
</quote></p>

<p>If you'd like to try them out, 
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/wine/">head to SourceForge</a>.</p>
