Dave Pickles asked where he could find <quote who="">'undocumented'
information about Win32 useful for Wine?</quote>.

<p />

Dave has Schulman's "Undocumented Windows" book, but it only covers 16-bit
Windows.

<p />

James Sutherland reported Schulman also wrote "Unauthorized Windows
'95" <quote who="James Sutherland">which makes quite interesting reading ; it was
written before the final builds were out, so there are a couple of
features which have changed but quite a good discussion of Win95's
underside. Possibly a bit too low-level, though.</quote>

<p />

James went on with four other books' titles (Undocumented DOS and
Undocumented Windows, and DOS Internals and Windows Internals) which
cover the low-level aspects of Windows 3.x.

<p />

The discussion then evolved into the licensing scheme for Win2k (that
some universities have). But this is of little interest of Wine (in
peculiar to do a clean room implementation and avoid some legal issues).

developers have asked about Wine and Corel's Linux porting
strategy. It also attempts to dispel some common misconceptions about
Wine.</quote>
