<issue num="322" date="02/19/2007" />
<intro> <p>This is the 322nd issue of the Wine Weekly News publication.
Its main goal is to use crutches. It also serves to inform you of what's going on around Wine. Wine is an open source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.  Think of it as a Windows compatibility layer.  Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely alternative implementation consisting of 100% Microsoft-free code, but it can optionally use native system DLLs if they are available.   You can find more info at <a href="http://www.winehq.org">www.winehq.org</a></p> <p>The stats below seem a little messed up and
were intended to be the stats since 1/1/2007.</p></intro>

<topic>News</topic>
<p>There's been a lot of news related to Wine in the past five months that
hasn't been covered, but I don't think we'll try to catch up on too much
of it.  Wine development releases have been appearing every two weeks
as they have been for the past year.  OLE, MSHTML, and Direct3D patches still
seem to be dominating wine-patches.  There's also been a lot of 
janitorial work done.  Alexandre noted the following changes in Wine
0.9.31 that was released last week:</p>
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard"><p><ul>
    <li> Many Direct3D fixes and performance improvements.</li>
    <li> Several new comctl32 test cases.</li>
    <li> IDL compiler improvements.</li>
    <li> More OLE32 marshalling fixes.</li></ul>
</p></quote>

<p>Over at CodeWeavers, we saw the CrossOver product have a milestone
release last month.  CrossOver 6.0, now slightly rebranded as <i>CrossOver
Linux</i> and <i>CrossOver Mac</i>, was released on January 9th.  
CodeWeavers showed off CrossOver Mac at WineConf in the fall and it's a
very impressive product.  There's a lot of new additions in this version
of CrossOver, including the beginnings of support for games.  As usual,
Jeremy White's announcement to the mailing list was more interesting than
the <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/about/general/press/?id=20070109a">press
release</a>.  From that announcement:</p>
<quote who="CodeWeavers"><p>
Users of Intel based Mac systems can now seamlessly run many
Windows applications on their Mac without needing a Windows license.
Supported applications include Outlook, Visio, Project, Quicken, Steam based 
games such as Half Life 2, and many more.
</p><p>
For Linux users, we have added support for Outlook 2003, World of Warcraft,
a range of Steam based games such as Half-Life 2, and a number of other
applications.  Additionally, CrossOver 6 represents another major step
forward in the evolution of Wine, so most users will find substantial
improvements in the overall compatibility and behavior of CrossOver
as compared to version 5.</p><p>

We are looking forward to 2007, as we plan to release
a range of improvements to CrossOver, particularly as we get
our Mac 'sea legs' underneath ourselves.  This will include refinements
to many of our supported applications, and will also hopefully
include expanded support for many other applications, notably games.
</p></quote>

<p>As far as Wine development goes, we'll probably start seeing some
fresh code appearing soon.  Generally CodeWeavers goes through a period
of about 6 months leading up to a release and shortly thereafter where
a lot of bugfixes appear.  After the initial release and initial round
of bugfixes there's several months where new features get implemented.
We're probably about ready to enter that phase.</p>

	title="DIB Engine Discussion"
	subject="DIB Engine, some summarization"
	archive="http://www.winehq.com/pipermail/wine-devel/2007-February/053977.html"
	posts="7"

<topic>Graphics</topic>
<p>The DIB Engine has been an item on Wine's tasklist for years.  In fact,
it's probably the single, largest outstanding task that hasn't been
tackled.  Part of the reason for that is Wine's graphics subsystem works
pretty well in most cases.  The motivation to fix the corner cases that
the DIB engine would address doesn't seem to exist.  Yet, most people
agree that a DIB engine would bring large performance benefits.  We've
covered this topic in depth many times and you can see the wiki page
for <a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/DIBEngine">a description</a> of 
exactly what the issue is.  The short version: we need to be able to
draw things within Wine that we're currently relying on the X server to
do.  Besides just writing the code, there's a huge concern about how to
integrate such a beast into Wine without hell breaking loose.  </p>
<p>Rolf Kalbermatter recently brought up the topic and wanted to get some
feedback on it.  After a long discussion of what's involved, he posted a
summary:</p>
<quote who="Rolf Kalbermatter"><p>
This is getting a bit long so if you do not have time, then skip this.
</p><p>
I've looked a little more at the issue of a DIB Engine and tried to use the
feedback
so far to get an idea of what the possible architecture could be.
</p><p>
First I took a look at how Windows seems to do it currently (excluding
Vista). There
GDI32 is mostly a wrapper around win32k.sys and the different GDI APIs call
mostly
into corresponding NtGdi... functions in win32k.sys.
</p><p>
Those functions do the actual handling and call the according driver that is
attached
to the DC. The interface to the driver is similar to what is done now in
Wine although
not identical. The modern Windows display driver interface uses sometimes
more or less
different functions than the old one as used in Wine.
</p><p>
A driver can either not implement certain functions, only implement them for
its device
specific surfaces, or hook certain calls by returning flags inside the
driver initialization
structure on initialization. Those hook flags tell the GDI engine that the
driver wants to
be called for DIB surfaces too for particular functions and bit depths. The
driver will then
be called for according DIB surfaces too and it can decide to do whatever it
can do best and
for those cases it doesn't know well how to do it, call back into the GDI
engine using an
according Eng... function. This calling back into the GDI engine for hooked
functions is
called punting by MS.
</p><p>
If the driver didn't provide the actual function it will possibly be
simulated by the GDI
engine by calling other driver functions and if the driver didn't hook the
function or didn't
succeed and it is for a DIB surface then the GDI engine itself will call the
corresponding Eng...
function. GDI32 exports most of those Eng... functions too but they are
simply user space
wrappers around the win32k.sys entry points for those functions.
</p><p>
From a design view it might be interesting to separate the actual GDI engine
into a subpart
that corresponds with the NtGdi... functions in win32k.sys even though they
might stay inside
GDI32 for the time being. The actual Eng... functions would be also placed
inside that GDI
engine and are in fact mostly the long awaited DIB engine. Such an
architecture would make
reuse of such a GDI32/win32k combo in other projects fairly easy.
However this NtGdi API is not documented although it is presumably mostly a
mirror of the
GDI API. There are lists of what APIs win32k.sys does export and how many
parameters each
of these functions takes, extracted from the actual win32k.sys file.
Even though Windows
keeps them in the win32k.sys kernel I think it would be a good idea to keep
them all in
GDI32 for the time being. If that API is at some time mostly complete and
separation into
its own DLL or something would be desired, this could be done quite easily.
But it is certainly quite a bit tedious to do and would require at least
partly some sort
of clean room reverse engineering and it's not really necessary for a DIB
engine at all
at this point.
</p><p>
There is a little problem with those Eng.. functions however. They are
modeled after the new
NT display driver interface that is in so far different that it does use
partly different
functions and parameters to the old (I assume Win 3.1 display driver)
interface used in Wine
and this is even more or less all documented in the DDK, although the basic
principle between
the Windows driver interface and what Wine does is of course mostly the
same.
</p></quote>

<p>Rolf brings up some good points, especially those regarding the newer
GDI interfaces that exist in Windows.  So while it doesn't seem like
Wine is any closer to a DIB engine, at least ideas are floating around.</p>

<topic>Summer of Code 2007</topic>
<p>Google's Summer of Code is back.  This year things are kicking off
a little earlier so there's some time to come up to speed with regards
to each project.  Tom Wickline announced it on wine-devel:</p>
<quote who="Tom Wickline"><p>
I see Google is going to do their summer of code again this year :-)
They plan to start accepting applications in March, so now would be
the time for us to propose new projects and review the ones we have
already listed on the Wiki for interested applicants? As well as line
up mentors for the accepted applicants?
<ul>
<li><a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/SummerOfCode">http://wiki.winehq.org/SummerOfCode</a></li>

<li><a href="http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/02/speaking-of-summer.html">http://google-code-updates.blogspot.com/2007/02/speaking-of-summer.html</a></li></ul>
</p></quote>

<p>Many of the projects on the wiki are still available to be worked on.
There's also about a bazillion other things you could take a stab at.</p>

<topic>Integration</topic>
<p>David Saez Padros did some work on getting Wine working better with the
freedesktop.org specs:</p>
<quote who="David Saez Padros"><p>
 I saw your post at 
<a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/GnomeMenusIntegration">http://wiki.winehq.org/GnomeMenusIntegration</a>
 and i made some freedesktop compliant files which:
<ul>
 <li> add a global Wine menu item in the Aplications menu (seen
    by all users) with WineFile and WineMine, which also merge
    all user specific wine installed programs.</li>

 <li> add a global menu item for winecfg in System -> Preferences
    (seen by all users)</li></ul></p><p>

 I also have what should be added to installation so .exe files
 are executed with wine when double-clicked (tested in ubuntu)
</p><p>
 How could i submit those files ?? I cannot find anything
 related to this in the bugzilla :(
</p></quote>

<p>Mike Hearn briefly described what to do:</p>
<quote who="Mike Hearn"><p>
Sounds great! To submit those files, you need to make a patch ... git
can do this but I don't remember the exact command to use (depends on
your setup also). Or you can do it the old fashioned way using diff
directly. Feel free to ask if you'd like more guidance with this.
</p><p>
Once you have a patch, email it to wine-patches at winehq.org so
Alexandre and the others can review it, suggest improvements etc. Good
luck!

<p>This work builds on the 
<a href="http://www.winehq.com/pipermail/wine-cvs/2006-November/028090.html">foundation</a> 
laid by Vitaliy Margolen in November for using the Freedesktop standard to 
create Wine's menu structure.</p>

<topic>DirectX</topic>
<p>To say Direct3D has seen a lot of work over the past few months would
be an understatement.  Stefan D&#246;singer and others have been pouring
patches in by the truckload.  After another round of patches, someone
commented:</p>
<quote who="Mirek"><p>
Wow, great work!!!!! 3DMark 2006 with fbo looks really coool!! And some 
Nvidia SDK demos are completely fixed!</p></quote>

<p>Following up on that, there were some screenshots posted:</p>
<quote who="Mirek"><p>
Yes, but after accepting this error message i can select some test and run the
benchmark, i have full version v102. I can't run any PS3 HDR test, GT1 
and GT2 tests are almost perfect, but very slow (fbo is slower than 
backbuffer, so I am not using it in other applications), you should also 
disable post processing (very very slow) in 3DMark. Here are some 
screenshots with latest wine and latest Stefan patches: 
<ul><a href="http://62.240.181.87/Mirek/3DMark2006/">
http://62.240.181.87/Mirek/3DMark2006/</a></ul></p></quote>

<p>Neil Skrypuch mentioned that 3DMark is rather fussy and might take
some coaxing to get to run,<quote who="Neil Skrypuch">
3DMark 05 and 06 are quite picky about caps, there's a few that are slightly 
off and it refuses to run</quote></p>

<p>Henri Verbeet then <a href="http://www.winehq.com/pipermail/wine-devel/2007-February/054134.html">provided</a> a patch that may help with it.</p>

<topic>Controls</topic>
<p>Common controls aren't something you hear a lot about in Wine
any more.  Sure, there's patches here and there, but for the most
part development has moved on.  Common controls are responsible
for all of the control mechanisms you see in a Windows program: scrollbars,
toolbars, listviews, etc.  Pavel Troller reported a regression that
occurred recently:</p>
<quote who="Pavel Troller"><p>
  I just found a regression in comctl32 and bisected it successfully.
  The following commit
<ul><code>
369749dcb2ba12ce8481503543afd18ad99805d1 is first bad commit<br />

causes IDA Pro to show black squares instead of its toolbar icons.

<p>Apparently this regression is causing problems in other programs too.
Dmitry was aware of the problem and referred him to

<topic>Packaging</topic>
<p>What's the most thankless job when it comes to Wine?  Packaging
and maintaining packages would be pretty high on the list.  Thanks
to Andreas Bierfert, Marcus Meissner, Ivan Leo Puoti, Adam Schreiber,
Scott Ritchie, Gerald Pfeifer, Kris Moore, and Robert Lunnon, Wine
has excellent coverage with up to date packages.  Bill Medland still
had a question though:</p>
<quote who="Bill Medland"><p>
I'm looking to see if there are rpms being built for Red Hat Enterprise
Linux 3 these days.
I see that the Red Hat rpms nowadays are for fc.  but they aren't
suitable for RHEL3
The download page says that the RedHat/Fedora area is for RedHat 8,9 and
Fedora, but I don't see any RedHat 8 or 9 there.  Are they not there or
am I looking in the wrong place?</p></quote>

<p>Lei Zhang then spoke up and mentioned that although the RPMs aren't
listed on Wine's 
<a href="http://www.winehq.com/site/download">Download</a> page, he maintains 
them:</p>
<quote who="Lei Zhang"><p>
I build RPMs for RHEL 3, give them a try:

<p>Darryl Dixon was pleased that the IE Developers Toolbar is now
working with Wine:</p>
<quote who="Darryl Dixon"><p>

Just a brief to let you know that it looks like Microsoft is finally
taking compatibility seriously ;)  - the new Beta 3 version of the IE
Developers Toolbar
(<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=e59c3964-672d-4511-bb3e-2d5e1db91038&amp;displaylang=en">link</a>) 
improves on the previous Beta release by installing and working correctly with 
wine 0.9.30 with an IE6 'ies4linux' install.</p><p>

In the previous Beta, the 'View DOM' button did not work in wine 0.9.30
- this new version fixes that and adds lots of enhancements. I don't
know if this is useful to many here, but it sure is for me, so I thought
I'd share. Nice to see Microsoft improving their software to work better
with Wine for once (even though I'm sure it's unintentional ;).</p></quote>
