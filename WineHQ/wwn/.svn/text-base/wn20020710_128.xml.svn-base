<p>The past few weeks have been relatively slow on news.  Then again, maybe
since I've been on vacation I've missed a lot.  If that's the case send me
any interesting news links you've seen and I'll include them next week.
</p><p>
<a href="http://www.emulinks.de/xmms-winamp/">A new plugin</a> for XMMD lets
you use Winamp plugins.  It's still under development, the latest version
is 0.2.  They suggest using WineX, although it looks like some Winamp plugins have
been tested with WINE 20020509.  Some of the plugins tested include G-Force 2, Geiss
4.23, and WhiteCap.  </p>

<p>Adam Luchjenbroers asked for a pointer on DGA input
in Wine:</p>
<quote who="Adam Luchjenbroers"><p>
 I was having trouble with DGA, where I would start up a DGA application and 
 it would not accept keyboard or mouse input.
</p><p>
 So I'd like to know how it was broken, where to look in the code, and what I 
 can do to help fix it. I want working DGA input and I'm willing to do the 
 coding to fix it. I was simply hoping someone could tell me where to look 
 instead of needing me to hunt for the problem, as this would save me time.
</p></quote>

<p>Serge Ryabchun posted a patch to try out and Adam reported back,
<quote who="Adam Luchjenbroers">
 Thanks, I have the WineHQ version of wine so I had to manually apply the 
 patch (thank god they're in a human-readable format) but now keyboard input 
 works fine.
 What needs to be done to make the mouse work?
 Thanks for your help so far and any you may give in the future.
</quote> After looking into it a little deeper he reported the following
problems:</p>  
<quote who="Adam Luchjenbroers">
<p>
Relative mouse motions are being picked up correctly, however 
X11DRV_GetCursorPos is always returning the same co-ordinate, which is 
probably where the cursor last was before running the game (Total 
Annihilation, in this case). 
</p><p>
Moving the cursor to the button and clicking saw the button respond, meaning 
click events were being properly received and the game had the 'correct' 
cursor position.

Bobby Bingham reported a problem getting Warcraft
3 to run under Wine:
</p><quote who="Bobby Bingham">
<p>
After buying Warcraft 3, and reading on the mailing list that the beta had
worked under wine, I decided to try the final version under wine.  It installed
fine, but won't run.  Or rather, when I try to run it, it prints this out, and
just sits there:
</p><p><code>
fixme:cdrom:CDROM_GetIdeInterface CD-ROM device with major ID 11 not supported
</code></p></quote>

<p>A couple of people seemed to recognize the problem and
wondered if a SCSI CD-ROM was present.  Bobby replied,
<quote who="Bobby Bingham">
it's actually an ide cdrom, using the ide-scsi emulation for cdrecord and
cdrdao.  if i turn off the scsi emulation, these messages go away, but it still
doesn't work.</quote></p>

<p>Jesse Allen posted some extensive directions for getting it to run:
</p><quote who="Jesse Allen"><p>
<ol><li>  Use the latest wine cvs.  Only that will work.

</li><li>  Mount the CD, and run install.exe on the CD with the winver set to
win98 under config.  (even though 95/98 are exactly the same when playing
the game--i hate that)  You should disable the ide-scsi thing because it
seems to cause problems =(

</li><li>  Close the install program.  Go to the
directory where war3 is installed.  mv the Movies folder to Movies backup.
 The game tries to display a movie clip on start in the retail, and it
hangs wine =(

</li><li>  Download the NoCD patch for Warcraft 3 v1.00 (I don't
know if 1.01 is out yet) at www.gamecopyworld.com.  mv war3.exe and
worldedit.exe to backup names.  Copy in the patched program exe's.  You
may now run War3 if you wish.  Warcraft 3 uses Safedisc v2.  With this
patch it will bypass it.  Run war3 with the command "wine war3.exe --
-opengl".

</li><li>  To login battle.net, you need to bypass the exe check.  With
the patched version of the game, it won't work.  So what I did to get it
to work is moved the patched exe's to something like "war3_patched.exe"
and create a symbolic link "war3.exe" that links to it.  Start the game
"war3.exe".  To login to battle.net, open bash console.  Change to the
war3 directory, and reset the symbolic link to the original war3 exe, let
it sleep 5 seconds, and then reset the symbolic link back to the patched
version.  While it's sleeping, you need to login into battle.net
immediately.  This is what I did to get D2 battle.net to work under wine.
It should work for war3.   You need to be the same version as battle.net
for it to work though. (currently only 1.00 is availible for linux, and
battle.net is 1.01)

</li><li>  To patch the game, you need to get the
standalone patches.  Set your symbolic link to the real exe's, and patch
away =)
</li></ol></p><p>

The beta in contrast worked perfectly.  The retail has a couple problems
=(.  The advantages I find running War3 under linux/wine/opengl, are
higher framerates than on both real windows, and winex.  And no graphics
errors in comparison to winex d3d8, and no sound problems like under real
windows.  My three button mouse also works unlike windows.   All these
advantages =)
</p></quote>

<p>Several people still reported problems getting it to work
so there's likely some other tweaks that need to be made.</p>

<p>Scott Bolte reported a problem with getting

tracked the problem down to autoconf but needed
some help to fix it.  Francois Gouget reported,
<quote who="Francois Gouget">
The bug was in the configure.ac file. Both Marcus and me sent patches
(different approaches ;-) to wine-patches. One of them has to be right
so this should be fixed pretty soon.</quote></p>

<p>That could be irrelevent soon anyway since another
tarball should be escaping from CVS any day now.</p>

<p>While trying to get AutoCAD R14 to work Max found
a problem where it was trying to get a registry key
value, but just getting an error and trying over and
over again.  Instead, along with the error message,
the correct buffer size was also supposed to be returned
so it could be retrieved.   After fixing it Max reported,
<quote who="Max">

With this patch, finally AutoCAD R14 is perfectly usable in wine, even without
a native windows installed !
</quote></p>

<p>He also gave some pointers to getting it running:
</p><quote who="Max"><p>
<ol><li>
Get latest wine from CVS (or wait for next release !)
</li><li>If registry patch isn't already there, get it here :

<a href="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-patches/2002/07/att-0034/01-registry.patch.dif">
www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-patches/2002/07/att-0034/01-registry.patch.dif</a>

and apply it to source code. If don't know how, mail me :)
</li><li> Just setup autocad and run it, all things I've tested
runs perfectly, rendering and external apps too.
</li><li> Only thing I found not working is Help, I guess must
update winhelp in wine.

<p>Clemens Eisserer had an announcement and some questions:
</p><quote who="Clemens Eisserer"><p>
I'm one of two web-masters of www.linux-wine.de . Many people in our
forum asked for a graphical frontend to the wine.config.
And because google didn't find anything, I've just written a prototype. It's
written in Java, is compiled to a native-Linux program via gcj and uses
java-gtk as toolkit. It is nearly as fast as a C++ program, but coding
is much faster und easier. And (for all GNU-fanatics) its fully
GPL-compatible....
</p><p>
My problem is, that I don't know all options of the config-file. Till now
I only implemented the options which stands in my wine-config, including
the ;-Entries. Only the specific-program settings are not iplemented,
its too hard to make this part GUI-based (I'm so sorry, but my english
is terrible). Is there somewhere an overview over all avaible options?
</p><p>
Is such a tool already avaible, or an existing codebase?
</p><p>
Please note that Jine (Jawy after the rewrite) isn't ready for use. O.K
it does work, but the code is awful and I'm currently working on a rewrite.
</p></quote>
<p><a href="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-devel/2002/07/att-0084/01-jine-screenshot.png">
A screenshot</a> was also attached to the email.</p>

<p>Andreas Mohr wondered why he bothered since the Tk-based Winesetup
has been around for a while.  But he added, <quote who="Andreas Mohr">
But a second program for this kind of task is always a good idea anyway.
