<p />

This is the 70th release of the Wine's kernel cousin
publication. Its main goal is to distribute widely what's
going on around Wine (the Un*x Windows emulator).

Andrew Lynch asked: 
<quote who="Andrew Lynch">
Has anyone successfully built Wine on Cygwin?  Before you laugh out
loud and send nasty flames, please read the whole message.  Thanks.

<p />

Cygwin recently added Xfree86 4.0 X server capability for Win NT/9x
which appeared to be the final component needed for a Wine port. It
has gcc and appears to have most if not all the tools needed to do a
Wine build.

<p />

I know already that Cygwin is not listed as one of the supported
platforms (as stated in the README) but it seems to me that Wine under
Cygwin would be an ideal test environment since it runs under Win
NT/9x directly alongside the app under test. It could be at least a
free alternative to running Wine on Linux/*BSD/Solaris with Win NT/9x
in VMware assuming Win NT/9x is already a sunk cost on most machines.

<p />

Andrew tried to compile Wine, but got some configuration error
messages, and asked for support.

<p />

Francois Gouget and Alexandre Julliard had a look at the trace
provided by Andrew. It turned out to be a configuration issue
(configure acted as it was running on NetBSD and returned some
erroneous information). A patch was provided which help Andrew go
further. But, he then got stucked by compilation errors in inline
assembly code. James Abbatiello and Dimitrie O Paun then helped fixing 
this issue.

<p />

Dimitrie made then a small wrap up of the situation:<quote who="Dimitrie Paun">
I have several hacks in my tree right now that allowed me to _compile_ 
most of wine. The compilation still fails in the server and the comm
support. Now, the big problem is that I do not know how to get .so in
Cygwin, and as such the linking fails ATM.

<p />

In other words, we are still far away from a working Wine!

<p />

Now, as Hidenori noticed, we should be able to create dynamically linked
libraries, but .dll rather than .so. So, the next tasks would be to:
<ol>
   <li>Modify the configure.in to test for this case</li>
   <li>Adjust the Makefile.in system to support .dll as an alternative</li>
   <li>Patch the winebuild program to use them</li>
</ol>
</quote>

<p />

So, some progress have been made, but no final result is available.

<p />

Francois Gouget reacting to this progress, but also to Plex86 being
able to run Windows95, added <quote who="Francois Gouget">
With all the progress being made it looks like soon we'll be able to
run Word 2000 in Wine on Cygwin, in Windows 95, in plex 86, on Linux! 
(in vmware on win2000, in ... oops, infinite loop) ;-)))

Zygo Blaxell sadly announced:<quote who="Zygo Blaxell">
Well, it's been fun, but I'm afraid I can no longer sustain the
Drunkard automatic Wine builds on my site. Some of the more radical
anti-Microsoft factions that influence content on hungrycats.org have
decided that there are better ways to use ~3% of that machine.

<p />

Effective immediately I'm removing the parts of the Drunkard web pages 
that instruct users how to add Drunkard to their Debian apt sources.list;
at the end of November, I'll stop the build process; at the end of the
millennium, the Drunkard web page will go away as well.

<p />

If anyone would like to set up a replacement for Drunkard, I would be
willing to provide a small amount of technical assistance to get you 
up and running. I'll also advertise your site on my site until the end 
of the millennium. After that, you're on your own (and you should
probably contact web-admin to get yourself listed at winehq.org). 
Good luck.
</quote>

<p />

Drunkard has been providing automatic RPM building for Wine, and an
heavy site for downloads (almost 800 users per day, with around 20 MB
of downloadable material (source and binary)).

<p />

Thanks Zygo for the help you provided to the Wine development. If
someone is willing to take over the Drunkard (server, technical setup
as well), you can contact <a href="mailto:web-admin@winehq.org">WineHQ 
administrators</a>.

Jeremy Newman has whipped up a proposed redesign for the WineHQ web site.

<p />

and asked for comments and reactions.

<p />

Lots of remarks sparked. Mostly on enhancements and broken links. Some 
interesting questions emerged though:
<ul>
   <li>in the logo, how shall the Wine glass be shaped. It looks more
a Champaign flute (some people like Uwe Bonnes even suggested some
other shapes from glass manufacturers). For the wine (it's a lower
case 'w') glass experts, it's not clear yet whether the Wine glass
shall be a Burgundy or a Bordeaux style glass. What about creating a
foundation to decide on that ? (oops we're not KDE nor GNOME)...</li>
   <li>some others didn't like the shadings on mouse over events for
the links (especially on slow connections)</li>
   <li>How should Wine be spelled ? (Wine vs WINE...) It turned out
Wine and WineLib seemed to reach some kind of consensus.</li>
   <li>Some layout enhancements were proposed</li>
</ul>

<p />

Apart from those sensitive remarks, the overall design seem to please
the Wine development community, so the cut over shall be done in a
short period of time.</section>

Paul Merrel reported some quotes he found in the press:

<quote who="Paul E. Merrell">
In the world according to Gates, the notion that Microsoft had a
monopoly was ludicrous. "Give me any seat at the table - Java, OS/2,
Linux - and I'd end up where I am," he proclaimed. "I could blow
Microsoft away! I'd have programmers in India clone our APIs. If you
were smart enough, you could do it."

<li>Article starts <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.11/microsoft.html">here</a></li>
</ul>

<p />

As Paul put it:
<quote who="Paul E. Merrell">
Just thought you might appreciate the confirmation that reconstructing
the Windoze APIs is possible. &lt;g&gt;  Seriously, the quote might be
useful should Microsoft later challenge the legality of the Wine work
product. Gates seems to be saying implicitly it's not only possible,
but legal to recreate the Windoze APIs. </quote>
