<topic>News</topic>

<p>Alexandre unleashed Wine-20020605.  There's some interesting
additions, many of which have occurred over the past week. Noted 
among the changes are:
<ul>
	<li> Better Mingw support, including cross-compilation on Linux.</li>
	<li> Still more dll separation work.</li>
	<li> Winelib applications now get loaded much like builtin dlls.</li>
	<li> Some command-line options replaced by config entries.</li>
	<li> Multimedia improvements, including an MP3 decoder.</li>
	<li> Massive whitespace cleanup.</li>
	<li> New Winelib file manager.</li>
	<li> Lots of bug fixes.</li>
</ul></p>


<p>This kind of dovetails nicely with last weeks' 
 <kcref subject="News" startdate="05/22/02">blurb</kcref> about Win4Lin.
"Open for Business" has an article this week titled
<a href="http://www.ofb.biz/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=119">
  Breaking Windows: CodeWeavers and NeTraverse Bring Office to Linux</a>:</p>
  <quote who="News"><p>
   This all leads to the question, which one should you buy - Win4Lin or 
   CrossOver Office? The answer really depends on your needs. If you are 
   mainly interested in using Word and Excel, or the other applications 
   supported by CrossOver Office, then that is definitely the best choice. 
   CrossOver Office ends up being more affordable due to its lower sticker 
   price and the fact that it frees you from needing a Windows license. 
</p><p>
   On the other hand, if you want to run applications not yet supported by 
   CrossOver Office such as Access, Office XP, Quicken, or Photoshop, Win4Lin 
   is for you. It is also for you if you use older Windows software or custom 
   software that may never be supported by CrossOver Office. If you are 
   currently using Windows, the cost of a Windows license is not of concern 
   and the vast benefits of avoiding constant rebooting between Windows and 
   Linux will pay off the Win4Lin license in no time.

<p>And Tom's Hardware has a great 
<a href="http://www.tomshardware.com/howto/02q2/020531/index.html">review</a> 
of WineX.  There's some benchmark numbers in there too that are interesting.
</p>

<p>Lindows.com has put together "Preview Release X".  Unless you're
part of their Insider program you can't get it.  Which, by the way
sounds almost interesting now that they've 
<a href="http://www.lindows.com/lindows_michaelsminutes_archives.php?id=12">
promised</a> that anyone who signs up for the Insider program will also
get the final version when it's released.  Anyway, over the past few months
there seems to have been a steady stream of subtle changes to what 
Lindows.com is putting together.  So here's the basic
scoop of how you could use this stuff:
<ul><li>Install LindowsOS on a bunch of computers.  The big 
	assumption here is you have a bunch of computers and preferably
	high-speed Internet access.</li>
	<li>Customize each one using some canned application packages
		available for download in the Warehouse section of their website.</li>
	<li>The license for LindowsOS follows the user, not the computer.
		So Lindows.com has an area on their website for each person
		to track what they've downloaded.  Need an application on
		another computer and forgot what it is?  Just log in and see
		what you downloaded.</li>
	<li>Repeat</li>
</ul></p>

<p>What I'd really like to see is a way for all of my preferences 
for every application to be saved on their site and a way to
migrate my preferences over to a new user.  Wouldn't it be cool
to sit down at your friend's computer, create a new account (or
use a generic "guest" account), and automatically download your
settings to it?  Sure, there's privacy concerns, but I can't 
tell you how many times I've edited .xinitrc files or wished I 
had my own .muttrc settings on hand.  But to take this a step
further, maybe my friend wants to use all of my KDE preferences
(background, theme, etc) but not my .vimrc or kppp settings - it 
would be nice if all those could be easily migrated between users.

<topic>Testing</topic>
<p>
There's been a push lately for "application owners" - people who
regularly use a Windows application that could occasionally test
that application with Wine to check for regressions or new
functionality.  Ian Pilcher stepped up to volunteer to own
the Lotus Notes R4 client:</p>
<quote who="Ian Pilcher"><p>
 I was under the impression that there already was one, but it looks like
 I was mistaken.  I will volunteer to own the Notes *R4* client, which I
 regularly use.  (I suggest having a different owner for Notes R5.)
</p><p>
 My employer only recently began providing a VPN access option for Linux,
 so I've only been back to using Notes with Wine for a few weeks, but it
 seems to be working very well.  The only bug I've noticed is that the
 left pane of the mail window (in which the "views" are shown) is resized
 to a zero width when the window is redrawn.
</p></quote>

<p>Dan Schwarz responded,
<quote who="Dan Schwarz">
 I'm the Lotus Notes application owner. I regularly use and test R5 on
 Linux, and I run a Linux Domino server at home. If you are interested in
 owning R4, that's fine by me. For what it's worth, from 1993-97 I was a
 programmer on the team that designed and wrote Notes R4 and R5 (Iris
 Associates) so I have some knowledge of application internals (although,
 sadly, no source code.)</quote></p>

<p>William Knop asked:</p>
<quote who="William Knop">
<p>
 I'm sure people have asked questions about integrating wine into the linux 
 kernel. Probably got flamed by everybody, yeah? But that's not what I'm 
 posting about. Not directly, anyway. =)
</p><p>
 I'm thinking of writing a kernel patch for PE executable support. Is there 
 any reason why wine libraries should not be used in a similar manner as 
 standard linux libraries? Granted wine is more than just it's libraries. 
 Anyway, good idea, bad idea?
</p></quote>

<p>In this manner running a Windows executable could be as simple
as typing "winword.exe" from a commandline.  Shachar Shemesh responded
with:</p>
<quote who="Shachar Shemesh"><p>
It's been a while since I looked at the compilation options of the 
kernel, but there used to be specific support for java applets in the 
kernel (running a userland jvm, mind you). That was later deprecated by 
a "MISC" handler, that (I guess) could be configured to run java, and 
probably also PE.
</p><p>
The idea is that trying to execve a PE file, will find the userland wine 
program and run it. This would make your effort needless.
</p></quote>

<p>Marco Pietrobono gave the details of setting it up:</p>
<quote who="Marco Pietrobono"><p>
  FWIW, it seems that both RedHat and Mandrake come with a script that
does the correct setup at boot.</p>
<p>
  All it does is:<br /><br />
  <ul><code>
  /sbin/modprobe binfmt_misc &amp;&gt;/dev/null<br /><br />

  echo ':windows:M::MZ::/usr/local/bin/wine:' 
                  &gt; /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register<br />

  echo ':windowsPE:M::PE::/usr/local/bin/wine:' 
                  &gt; /proc/sys/fs/binfmt_misc/register<br />

<topic>Licensing</topic>
<p>
<editorialize who="Brian Vincent">I started out not wanting
to cover this thread.  I don't think there's a lot of news
in it, however the discussion is ongoing and there may be
some value noting how everyone feels.  A lot of developers think the
move to the LGPL license was the right thing to do, but it
hasn't been without problems.  And please don't consider
this summary in any way complete - a lot has been left out
and there seems to be a lot of discussion taking place off
the lists.  This summary may not seem coherent, and the
quote are definitely taken out of context.  </editorialize></p>

<p>First, I'll refer you to the top level thread from which
the following quotes came from: 
 <a href="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-license/2002/05/0090.html">
 WineX and the AFPL</a></p>

<p>Here's random quotes in no particular order.</p>

<p>Alexandre Julliard:</p>
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard"><p>
the point of the LGPL is not to make TransGaming release their code,
they have clearly no intention of doing that anyway; it's to encourage
other companies to not adopt TransGaming's model and instead choose a
business model based on collaboration instead of code hoarding. We
have seen the first effects of that in the fact that Lindows is now
working from the LGPL code base instead of their private tree. This
increased collaboration between all Wine companies will be much better
for Wine in the long run than whether or not TransGaming releases an
(already obsolete) version of their COM code.
</p><p>
And from my personal perspective, I no longer enjoy seeing my code
being used by TransGaming in a way that hurts Wine by discouraging
future development. And that's what I like about the LGPL: I no longer
need to worry about license changes, proprietary extensions, etc.
I can simply have fun writing code again. I'm not going to give that
up just to help TransGaming to continue with their broken model.
</p></quote>

<p>Ove K&#229;ven:</p>
<quote who="Ove Kaaven"><p>
But CodeWeavers (and Alexandre) are clearly less interested in
such collaboration (they've so far refused all requests for ways to
collaborate), so that argument doesn't apply either. Alexandre apparently
values the fun of coding more than collaboration, and CodeWeavers
apparently values the power of the LGPL during negotiations more than
collaboration. Beats me why you consider them OSD-compatible.
</p></quote>

<p>Alexandre:</p>
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
<p>
 I'm perfectly willing to collaborate with TransGaming, and any other
 company out there, under *reasonable* terms. I happen to think the
 LGPL is an example of perfectly reasonable terms, and all the other
 Wine companies I talked to (CodeWeavers, Lindows, Macadamian, OsoComm)
 agree with that.
</p><p>
 I'm also willing to make specific exceptions to the license for
 TransGaming if that turns out to be necessary for copy protection
 etc. as I already mentioned to Gav in private mail.
</p></quote>

<p>Jeremy White: <i>(the full email can be found
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-license/2002/05/0126.html">here.
 </a>)</i></p>
<quote who="Jeremy White"><p>
First, I resent the implications that CodeWeavers somehow
forced a switch to the LGPL.  Please understand that
this is something that Alexandre, as Wine maintainer, felt
was important to do.  If Alexandre had acted on my
behest in this matter, Wine would have been LGPL
a long time ago  (and boxed comments would be mandatory
&lt;grin&gt;).  Further, Alexandre was very uncomfortable
taking this action until he felt that a majority
of the non CodeWeavers Wine developers were behind
the switch as well.
</p><p>
Second, I resent the portrayal of our actions as
being intended to harm TransGaming.  I have known
Gav personally for a long time, and I wish both
he and TransGaming the best. 
</p><p>
I guess what I'm saying is that I still feel the
switch to LGPL is better, *despite* the distress
it has caused TransGaming; everyone seems to be
implying that I advocate for the LGPL
*because* of the harm it does to TransGaming - and
that's the part I resent.
</p></quote>

<p>Dimi Paun:</p>
<quote who="Dimitrie Paun"><p>
 This is like having sex/children. That is, some people are content to just
 have sex all their lives, without caring to have children. Most other though
 enjoy having sex, but they want kids as well. Obviously, the analogy I'm
 trying to make here is sex=coding, children=project :). Nobody denies that
  the sex/coding thing is the fun part ;). Now, if you don't care about the
 result of your fun, you're a BSD guy, 'cause you only like to share. On the
 other hand, if you care about the well being of said result, you may be
 willing to even give up a little on the fun part to protect it. Most people
 actually do that -- they do give up quite a bit of fun to have &amp; protect
 (their) kids.
</p></quote>

<p>Patrik Stridvall:</p>
<quote who="Patrik Stridvall"><p>
 We have been through this before and again there is a difference between
 the MEANS and the GOALS.</p>
<p>

 We doesn't really disagree on the goals, that is not the
 problem. The means (the LGPL) is the problem. Please focus on that
 instead of trying to sell the goal to people that already mostly agree.
</p></quote>

<p>Alexandre:<i>(the full email can be found
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-license/2002/05/0125.html">
 here.</a>)</i></p>
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard"><p>
 As I tried to explain, the value to the
 project is not in a specific patch, or in a number of lines of
 code. It's in the collaboration that allows everybody to build on each
 other's code. *That* is what makes the open source model so powerful
 to build software, and that is precisely what TransGaming is hurting
 with their release policy.
</p><p>
 The important point about the LGPL is that it ensures that *future*
 versions of the code will be available, which in turn allows anybody
 to work on improving the code, knowing that the work they do will be
 useful.
</p></quote>

<p>And in another email:</p>
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard"><p>
 Given that there is no evidence whatsoever that the LGPL has caused
 harm (and no, TransGaming hasn't stopped contributing as you seem to
 think, they have submitted some patches since the change), I think
 it's a reasonable conclusion to say that 3 months after the change the
 LGPL has already helped Wine a good deal. No it's not a mathematical
 proof, so feel free to continue denying it if that makes you happy.
</p></quote>

<p><editorialize who="Brian Vincent">
Was any of that news?  I don't think so.  The theme comprising
this thread seems to center on how the license change will
affect future commercial development.  TransGaming didn't
add to the discussion, but I don't blame them.  They've made 
their view known and I don't think there's much to add.  As
Deven Corzine put it,
<quote who="Deven Corzine">
Whether they're right or wrong, they should be allowed to succeed or fail 
on the merits of the business model they choose to use.</quote></editorialize>

<topic>Debugging</topic>
<p>Tijs van Bakel asked for thoughts concerning future 
development of debugging under Wine.  Currently Wine has
it's own built in debugger, but there's been some discussion
of heading in a different direction.  Tijs wrote,
<quote who="Tijs van Bakel">
 I'd like to improve debugging support for Wine, and have time to
 undertake a larger project.  Either I could work on winedbg to match
 gdb's features, or I could try to make gdb understand Wine better.
 Given the amount of useful frontends for gdb, it seems wiser to go for
 the second option.  I'd love to be corrected if you think working on
 winedbg is a better choice.</quote></p>

<p>Michael Cardenas mentioned:</p>
<quote who="Michael Cardenas"><p>
 This was discussed at wineconf, well, getting gdb to work with wine was
 discussed at wineconf because of the huge value in having a graphical
 front end for debugging. 
</p><p>
 One major problem is that gdb doesn't understand wine's handling of
 windows threads, even if it does understand the windows pe format. 
</p></quote>

<p>Eric Pouech had already started looking at it:</p>
<quote who="Eric Pouech"><p>
 I already have up &amp; running (even if everything is not perfect) 
 an implementation of the gdb remote target in winedbg. Basically, 
 this allows the following scheme:<br />
 <ul><code>
 gdb &lt;gdb remote protocol&gt; winedbg &lt;Win32 debug API&gt; wineserver
 </code></ul>
</p><p>
winedbg is in this case just a proxy between the gdb remote protocol and the Win32 debug API.
</p><p>
This works quite well, with decent performance (even using the remote protocol). 
However, this doesn't support the standard Windows debug formats (as winedbg does). 
I've also started looking at the way to integrate this into gdb, but it still 
requires lots of work before being operational.
</p></quote>

<p>Eric <a href="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-devel/2002/05/0659.html">
went on</a> to list the various options available for improving the
debugger and the features needed. </p>

<p>Michael Wetherell had 
 <a href="http://www.winehq.org/hypermail/wine-devel/2002/06/0051.html">some ideas</a>
on how to use gdb.  Specifically he discussed symbol loading and working
with threads.</p>
