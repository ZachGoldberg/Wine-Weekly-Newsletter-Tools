going on around Wine (the Un*x Windows emulator).

Andreas Mohr tried to let native Win 3.1 USER.EXE be loaded under
Wine. One of the issues Andi had was USER DLL trying to get one
specific resource from the DISPLAY DLL (the DLL handling part of the
video card). There was no way to add resources to a Wine DLL, so,
Ulrich Weigand quickly provided a patch for this, but was afraid that
running native USER.EXE from Win 3.1 will not be so easy (mainly
because of the absence of 32 bit routines from Windows 3.1 USER).

Patrik Stridval forwarded an <a
href="http://www.newsalert.com/bin/story?StoryId=CoddK0bKbytaYmJm&amp;FQ=Linux&amp;Nav=na-search-&amp;StoryTitle=Linux">
article</a> about GraphOn Corp. acquiring a patent which describes how
to display remotely Windows Applications on UNIX (and Linux) boxes
using the X protocol.

<p />

Even if everybody agrees this is again a ridiculous patent, it may
impair Wine, as well as other programs like VNC which all use X as the
display protocol between server and client to display Windows'
applications (Wine also displays Windows application through the X
protocol, even if X client and server sit on the same machine).

  title="Big Apps"

More and more people are working to get big applications (Internet
Explorer, Outlook 98...) to work correctly under Windows. There has
been some progress this week, such as IE5 finally displaying the images,
and Outlook getting a bit further. Those are still non-functional
applications, but it's always good news to see those big and complex
applications start to work.
