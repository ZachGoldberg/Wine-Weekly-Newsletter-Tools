<p>Welcome to the Christmas / New Year's edition of the Wine Weekly News.  
I hope you're enjoying the holidays. We're also celebrating issue #150, 
which is exciting in a sesquicentennial sort of way.  This past year 
has brought some of most exciting Wine developments ever, and next year 
promises even more.  
</p>

<p>Information Week published an article this week about NASA
engineers using Wine.  
"<a href="http://www.informationweek.com/story/IWK20021223S0001">
Bridging Unix and Window at NASA</a>" is light on details but
mentions, <quote who="InformationWeek">
The Johnson Center's IT team installed CrossOver Office from 
CodeWeavers Inc. on McCartney's PCs to give the engineers access 
to a variety of open-source and Microsoft Office apps.</quote></p>

<p>A lot of Direct3D work has been done by Lionel Ulmer and
others over the past few weeks.  Lionel wrote in with some
news:</p>
<quote who="Lionel Ulmer"><p>
As it was one of my objectives when Christian's work prodded me into
restarting working on D3D, I am happy to show here the first screen
shot of SystemShock2 working (alas texture-less) with Wine :
<ul>

Merry Christmas to everybody :-)
</p><p>
   Lionel (with one week and a half of almost full-time hack vacation
           left :-) )
</p></quote>

<p>The next day Lionel posted a link to some of the things he's 
testing with and their status:</p>
<quote who="Lionel Ulmer"><p>
I created a small web page with the list of the demos / games I am using to
test Direct3D and their various status. If anyone of you has a demo that is
almost running (ie it starts in D3D mode and does not crash to reason not
linked to D3D) and you want me to look at it, send me a private mail and we
will see what I can do (once I come home to my ADSL line :-) ).
</p><p>
I would also be glad of people testing the same demos than me with other
OpenGL libraries to see if they have the same texturing problem that I have.

Dan Kegel has been on a quest to get Microsoft's Visual C++
development environment to work under Wine.  This week he
reported success:</p>
<quote who="Dan Kegel"><p>
wine still needs some polish before it can install msvc4 nicely,
but it can indeed install it, and the installed copy of msdev
appears to work!  I used the IDE to create a "hello, world"
console app, and it compiled and ran perfectly!
</p><p>
The UI seems snappy enough on my dual pentium 650, too.
</p><p>
I'm sure I'll find many problems with this later, but for now,
I think it's awesome that Wine can install and run msvc4 at all!
</p></quote>

<p>He gave some more details in a different post
about some of the hoops he had to jump through,
<quote who="Dan Kegel">
With native mfc42.dll, riched20.dll, and wordpad.exe, and
winefile running, I can put the msvc4.0 cd-rom in the drive, mount it,
click on the 'd:' drive icon in winefile, double-click on setup.exe,
and the setup program launches properly; clicking on "Standard Template Library"
properly brings up WordPad (yay!), but with a display problem (see below); clicking
on "Explore the CD" does nothing (because I didn't install native Windows Explorer).

<p>Dimi Paun updated his page about compiling Windows
apps with Winelib:</p>
<quote who="Dimitrie Paun">
<p>
It's been almost a month since the last release of the
Winelib page, and a _lot_ has changes since then:
<ul>
    <a href="http://63.138.153.104/wine/Winelib-Apps-0.2.html">
    http://63.138.153.104/wine/Winelib-Apps-0.2.html</a></ul>
</p><p>
The page has been reorganized, enhanced, etc. Too many
changes to list here. If you haven't followed the working
version, it's a good time to check it out.

	title="wxWindows Under Wine"

<p>Dimi Paun's work with Winelib continues.  This week he worked
on porting wxWindows to Wine.  
<a href="http://www.wxwindows.org">wxWindows</a> is a cross-platform
API that can be used to create GUI apps that work on multiple
platform.  Kind of ironic to try compiling the Windows code
under Linux, but Dimi explained:</p> 
<quote who="Dimitrie Paun"><p>
Last night I managed to compile, link, and successfully run
all(1) samples that come with wxWindows.
</p><p>
In all honesty I am overjoyed! Let me explain why:
<ul>
  <li>wxWindows is a large piece of software that touches on
     most (if not all) Wine aspects. It does put our headers
     through their paces.</li>
  <li> The porting effort has been simple, and it took me
     a just a few days to do it.</li>
  <li> I have not used _any_ of the previous efforts to port
     wxWindows to Wine. I rather started with their MinGW port.</li>
  <li> Most of the changes have been trivial fixes for Wine
     which I have sent to wine-patches in the last few days.</li>
  <li> The hacks to wxWindows have been trivial and few in
     number. I have touched only a few files, and the
     changes are real simple. They'll need some cleaning up,
     and I'll submit them to the wxWindows folks for inclusion.</li>
  <li> The wine{gcc,wrap} combo is a great success. All I had
     to do was to touch only *one* file (makeg95.env), and
     modify only a few lines to get *everything* to compile
     and link.</li>
</ul></p><p>
What does Wine get out of it:
<ul>
  <li> A good test for our headers</li>
  <li> Proof that wine{gcc,wrap} are a good idea (at least for me)</li>
  <li> A large number of sample that show quite a few problems in Wine.</li>
</ul></p><p>
If anyone is interested in more details please let me know, and I'll
be glad to provide them. Once we decide on the __WINE__ vs. __WINESRC__
thing, I'll cleanup the wxWindows changes and submit them for inclusion
in their tree, so hopefully you'll be able to play with it using the
official version not before long.
</p><p>
Notes
<ol>
  <li> All but a few:
 <ul>
       <li> 'dialup' did not compile because I had to disable dialup
         support in wxWindows since wine does not have a wininet.h</li>
       <li> 'proplist' did not compile because I forgot to enable property
         lists in the configuration when I compiled wxWindows</li>
       <li> 'tab' sample did not compile because it's recommended
         to not enable this deprecated option, so I did not.</li>
       <li> the samples 'listbox', 'memcheck', and 'opengl/*' are not
         supported by wxWindows under MinGW, so I did not bother.</li>
 </ul></li></ol></p></quote>

<p>Tom Wickline updated the Wine Contribution page and
put a draft up for review.  Dimi Paun put it on his site
and noted:</p>
<quote who="Dimitrie Paun">
<p>
Tom Wickline took over the Wine Contrib page, and
cleaned it up. He already went through 4 iterations,
and asked me to post it on my site for your reviewing
pleasure:<ul>
	<a href="http://63.138.153.104/wine/Wine-Contrib-0.4.html">
   http://63.138.153.104/wine/Wine-Contrib-0.4.html</a></ul>
</p><p>
Please take a look at it, and let us know what you
think. The idea is to get it over with as soon as
possible so that work on other pages can commence.
</p></quote>

<p>There's several good ideas in on how to get involved.</p>
