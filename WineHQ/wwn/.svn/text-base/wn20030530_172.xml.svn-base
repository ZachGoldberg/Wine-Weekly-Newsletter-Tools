<intro>
<p>This is the 172nd release of the Wine's kernel cousin publication. 
  Its main goal is to be as short and concise as possible so I can
  enjoy my vacation.
  It also serves inform you of what's going on around Wine (the Un*x 
  Windows emulator).</p>

<p>Frank's Corner surpassed a 1000 posts in the 
<a href="http://www.frankscorner.org/wineforum">application forum</a>.  </p>

<p>Slow news week?  Yeah, you could say that.  I'm also on vacation,
so some of the threads aren't covered completely.  Alexandre is also
on vacation, so there hasn't been as much CVS activity this week.  I'd
expect a new Wine release next week but we'll have to see.</p>

<topic>Project Management</topic>
<p>Based on last week's IRC meeting Dimi updated the
To Do list.  The biggest change is moving things from
a 0.9 to-do list to a 1.0 to-do list.  It certainly makes
the 0.9 one seem much more complete:</p>

<quote who="Dimitrie Paun"><p>

A new version (v0.9) of the Wine 0.9 TODO is available
for your viewing pleasure at:
<ul><a href="http://63.138.153.104/wine/Wine-0.9-TODO-0.9.html">
    http://63.138.153.104/wine/Wine-0.9-TODO-0.9.html</a></ul>

</p><p>
The work-in-progress one is available at:
<ul><a href="http://63.138.153.104/wine/Wine-0.9-TODO.html">
    http://63.138.153.104/wine/Wine-0.9-TODO.html</a></ul>

</p><p>
Most important changes in this one is that a bunch of
stuff was moved over to the Wine 1.0 TODO:

<ul><a href="http://63.138.153.104/wine/Wine-1.0-TODO.html">
    http://63.138.153.104/wine/Wine-1.0-TODO.html</a></ul>
</p><p>
Any feedback concerning this (rather large) changes
is more than welcomed.

<topic>Integration</topic>
<p>Supporting compiled HTML help files has been a bit of a
problem with Wine.  We've covered this before, most recently
in <a href="http://www.winehq.org/index.php?issue=153#IWebBrowser%20Status%20/%20More%20Ideas">
issue #153</a>.

Someone wrote to the list this week with
some info and wondered if it would be helpful in the effort:</p>
<quote who="Pabs"><p>
Just wondering if Wine folks are implementing a chm viewer and if you would be 
interested in a specification on the internal files of CHMs and even 
relicencing some of the code for my chm decompiler.</p>
<p>
all at <a href="http://bonedaddy.net/pabs3/hhm/">http://bonedaddy.net/pabs3/hhm/</a>
</p><p>

BTW; please cc me in replies since, while i'm subscribed i don't want to get 
heaps of other wine discussion &amp; so i've turned off mail delivery.
</p></quote>

<p>Ender wrote back with a detailed description of the problem:</p>
<quote who="James Brown"><p>
I've already written the major chuck of a CHM viewer - to the point I have
a native Windows viewer using nothing but the WebBrowser ActiveX control.
</p><p>
The secondary problem is how to display the HTML + JavaScript needed for a
CHM viewer. I've started work on this several times, and so far the *best*
(in terms of existing compatibility with IE's CSS/JS/HTML 'features') has
been KJs and KHtml from the KDE project.
</p><p>
Gecko doesn't cut it - it's quite slow, bulky and worst of all too strict
on standards compliance. Nothing you want in a Windows system component.
Well, not the last one anyway :)
</p><p>
However KHTML and KJS -are- tied to the QT library. It's quite possible to
decouple them (the embedded konq suite already does this to some extent,
as does WebCore from Apple's Safari project)... however it is somewhat
time consuming. Using WebCore can probably greatly speed this up of
course.
</p><p>
I ran into two other problems. First, I have gotten a Windows-native
KHTML/KJS viewer running - however splitting it into an API mapping to the
existing dll structure is complicated... and I know next to nothing about
writing ActiveX objects.
</p><p>
The second is that I never could get an answer from Alexandre as to adding
C++ code to WINE itself. It would be possible to write it as a separate
non-core implementation, but many of these DLLs also have non-browser
related APIs that need to be in WINE itself. Again, diverting api calls
between the versions in WINE and our browser versions is complicated and
in this case plain ugly.
</p><p>
Anyway, that's all rather off-topic... we can already build a CHM viewer,
it's displaying the HTML/JS that's the problem :)
</p></quote>

<p>A bunch of people wrote in to discuss the idea of using KHTML, but
the fact that it relies on Qt is a major problem.  The solution would be
to find a de-Qt'ed version and begin using it.  Such a version seems
to exist, Mark Westcott pointed out AtheOS seemed to have done such a
thing at one point.  Mike Hearn felt Internet Explorer itself was easy
enough to get running under Wine that it could be used.  </p>

<topic>Documentation</topic>
<p>Tom Wickline changed the documentation to remove compression 
when using  cvs.  Andi Mohr wanted to know why that was done because 
people on slow connections could definitely benefit from it.  
Marcus Meissner pointed out cvs was broke,
<quote who="Marcus Meissner">
Because <tt>cvs -z3</tt> still hangs at the end of any cvs command.
</quote></p>

<p>A couple people pointed out that compression could be used if
the cvs client was updated.  Fabian Cenedese gave a pointer to 
a good client:</p>
<quote who="Fabian Cenedese"><p>
 If a warning/info goes into the dox then it should be like:
 "... use cvs 1.11.5 or bigger..." as recently the new version
 1.11.6 came out. I haven't tried it though.

	title="Using Ventrilo"

<topic>Fixes</topic>
<p>Kristoffer Ericson gave a pointer to some software that works with
Wine - Ventrilo.  From their website:</p>
<quote who="Ventrilo"><p>
Ventrilo is a scalable Voice over IP (VoIP) communications system that 
solves a lot of the problems associated with network latency, packet 
loss, uptime and administration.
</p><p>
Ventrilo can be used for home / personal applications like talking to 
friends and family, or playing organized online games where Voice Comm 
can make them more exciting and productive. It can also be used in an 
enterprise environment as a productivity tool for conducting long distance 
group discussions.</p></quote>

<p>Kristoffer included some tips to get it running:</p>

<quote who="Kristoffer Ericson"><p>
Just wanted to point out that Ventrilo (www.ventrilo.com) works in wine with 
abit of work. Although it requires 3 files (gsm 6.10 codec among other 
things). The bug i'm left with currently is that when 2 people speak (at 
same time), it freezes up.</p>
<p>
Ventrilo will probobly make a linux version but wanted you all to know.
