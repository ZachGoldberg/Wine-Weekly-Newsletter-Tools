<intro> <p>This is the 275th issue of the Wine Weekly News publication.
Its main goal is to freeze. It also serves to inform you of what's going on around Wine. Wine is an open source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.  Think of it as a Windows compatibility layer.  Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely alternative implementation consisting of 100% Microsoft-free code, but it can optionally use native system DLLs if they are available.   You can find more info at <a href="http://www.winehq.org">www.winehq.org</a></p> </intro>

<topic>Documentation</topic>
<p>One of the reasons for moving the documentation to SourceForge
was to enable a new framework to allow for easier translations.  Dimi
is currently maintaining the documentation CVS and integrating some
patches from Francois Gouget for internationalization.  Francois
is using
<a href="http://po4a.alioth.debian.org/">po4a</a> to help with this.
One of the big advantages is being able to see just how much of a
document has been translated or exactly how out of date it is.  That
framework seems to be in place now, so the actual translations can
be done.  </p><p>

Of course, it leads to the question of just how much work
needs to be done on Wine's docs.  For example, we know the Winelib
User Guide is horribly out of date, so translating it won't help much.
The Wine User Guide is in decent shape, but will soon be out of date
when we remove the config file.  The actual Wine
Developers Guide seems to be in great shape, especially with the
recent contributions by Eric Pouech.  Of all the docs, the FAQ is
probably holding up the best.  After the massive effort a few years
ago to assemble it, there hasn't been very many changes.  Francois
sent in a patch this week with a French translation of it done
by Romuald Vieux and Yvon Benoist:</p>
<quote who="Francois Gouget"><p>

 I was away on vacation in the past few days which is why this got 
delayed a bit. But now that I'm back, here's a patch to translate the 
Wine FAQ to French using the new po4a/ directory. Note that the patch is 
pretty big : 136KB (not compressed). That's because that's how big the FAQ 
translation is. Once this is in I will send patches to add a translation 
for the Wine User Guide and the WineLib User Guide.
</p><p>
Note that configure will need to be regenerated.
</p><p>
Changelog:
<ul>
    Francois Gouget &lt;fgouget_at_codeweavers.com&gt;<br />
    Add a framework to handle the translation of Wine's documentation 
using po4a.<br /><br />

    Romuald VIEUX<br />
    Yvon BENOIST<br />
    Translate and proof-read the Wine FAQ to French.</ul></p></quote>

<p>Dimi looked over the translation and the accompanying po4a framework
that had been set up and remarked:</p>
<quote who="Dimitrie Paun"><p>

OK, I've applied the patch to make your life easier,
but it needs a lot of work:
<ul>
 A. It doesn't work for me (details below)<br /><br />
 B. The po-rules need to be moved to Make.rules.in<br /><br />
 C. We need to get rid of the .posgml and sed hack</ul></p><p>

Let's fix these before we put in more translations.
So, in reverse order:
<ul>
 C. We can do so by patching po4a-translate to
    do the replacement itself, from within perl.
    This should also get rid of the .posgml<br /><br />

 B. They need to be in the same format as the
    other rules in Make.rules.in (eg .sgml.txt)<br /><br />

 A. I think we need to check in the generated
    .sgml too to make it simple to use, so
    others don't have to go through the pain.
    Look:<br />

<topic>Status Updates</topic>
<p>Maarten Lankhorst has continued spending a lot of time working on
webcam support and getting a lot of related patches in.  The goal of
this is to get MSN Messenger to run.  On Wednesday
he gave a pointer to a document on the wiki he's been updating:</p>
<quote who="Maarten Lankhorst"><p>
Status: Nearly complete, need testers.

You need the native quartz dll, which gets installed with internet 
explorer, as the builtin quartz doesn't work properly when changing 
media format on initialisation. IFilterGraph Reconnect isn't 
implemented, and for some reason *looks strangely at Robert* instead of 
a FIXME() there's a TRACE telling it is a stub...</p></quote>

<p>Maarten then took a closer look at the builtin quartz DLL and found
some problems with it.  It appears he was able to fix them and get it
to work.  That might mean you can skip the Internet Explorer installation,
though perhaps there's another dependency on it.</p>

<p>This was a pretty slow week on the wine-devel mailing list.  However,
tons of patches arrived on wine-patches and Alexandre did a boatload of 
commits.  I guess a lot of people had their heads down getting work done.
One short thread about recent windowing problems did pop up.  Jason
Edmeades asked:</p>
<quote who="Jason Edmeades"><p>
Ok, I need advice on this one...
</p><p>
I have been purely testing on windows, no wine involvement, to see what
happens when I do various things.
</p><p>
My test program doesn't do anything in the WM_PAINT handler at all. This
results in the machine sitting at 100% CPU processing WM_PAINT messages.
<ol>
<li> Changing the WM_PAINT process to post another user message, results in
alternating message posted and WM_PAINT messages, ie normal user message
processing is occurring</li>

<li> Posting a user message inside the user message handler, results in
WM_PAINT being driven, followed by looping processing the user messages - ie
WM_PAINT messages are not on the message queue</li>

<li> RedrawWindow with update now jumps straight into the message routine with
a WM_PAINT, but if we do nothing in that routine, it does indeed proceed to
the line after the RedrawWindow call. Wine never leaves the updatenow
processing because it loops until the whole region is validated.</li>
</ol></p><p>
I believe staying in the updatenow code in wine is incorrect. I think what
happens is that when the message dispatch loop gets an empty queue and the
window has an invalid region, then a WM_PAINT is returned.
</p><p>
So... Can we / I please remove the loop? :-))
</p><p>
What other tests can I do under windows to confirm the behaviour?
</p></quote>

<p>Alexandre had a pretty short answer,
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">

Sure you can, you just need to figure out a way to do that without
breaking something else ;-)</quote></p>

<p>Jason wondered how to go about testing this more:</p>
<quote who="Jason Edmeades"><p>
Woohoo... Should be easy then!
</p><p>
From forum updates it appears Notes, Unreal2, UT2003, UT2004, Empire Earth
and MS Office 2003 for a start are all affected by this problem, and testing
seems to confirm it's wrong, so I would start by changing it with a patch and
see what breaks, since we have no evidence anything will as far as I know.
</p><p>
But first I'll have a play under wine to compare my test results with my
suggested patch and see what breaks...
</p><p>
Unfortunately I can't really think of a 'test' I can add into the wine tests
for this as most of the testing was under windows since wine just loops!</p>
</quote>

<p>Alexandre suggested,
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">

It only loops if the window procedure doesn't validate the window, so
what you can do for instance is to have a window proc that does
nothing the first 10 times around, and on the 11th call signals an
error and validates the window to break the loop.</quote></p>

<topic>Documentation</topic>
<p>Dimi Paun forwarded an email asking for someone to make some changes
to the FAQ.  I decided to do it but quickly discovered the FAQ was one
of the docs that got moved to SourceForge (see 
<a href="http://www.winehq.com/?issue=274#Documentation%20Moved%20to%20SourceForge">WWN #274</a> for details.)  
I figured it was a good time to add an FAQ entry about how to update the
FAQ as well.  Now that those new entries were added, it led me to ask,
<quote who="Brian Vincent">
has WineHQ been updated to build the FAQ/docs from SF rather than WineHQ CVS?
</quote></p>

<p>Dimi replied,
<quote who="Dimitrie Paun">
No, I haven't had time to rewrite those scripts.
If someone is kind enough to help out on this one,
I'd really appreciate it.</quote></p>

<p>I asked him where the scripts lived since it's an area most people are
probably unfamiliar with.  He answered:</p>
<quote who="Dimitrie Paun"><p>
They are in the tools/ module in the WineHQ CVS:
<ul><a href="http://cvs.winehq.org/cvsweb/tools/"> 
	http://cvs.winehq.org/cvsweb/tools/</a> </ul></p><p>

Namely 'make_winehq' and 'wine_release'.</p></quote>

<p>If you look at those scripts, you'll see make_winehq is the one
responsible for updating the docs on the website.  It looks like wine_release
needs to run first though to create the directory referenced by make_winehq.
If someone could spend some time updating those scripts we'd appreciate it.

<topic>WineHQ</topic>
<p>The <a href="http://wiki.winehq.org">Wine Wiki</a> has really
taken off.  Lots of people have added info over the past few weeks.
A bunch of interesting docs appeared, many of which are working
drafts of areas people are looking into.  Check out the 
<a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/RecentChanges">RecentChanges</a>
to see the activity going on.  Mike Hearn posted
another debugging doc and asked on wine-devel:</p>
<quote who="Mike Hearn"><p>
This time, it's how to debug PE Explorer hanging when you double click on
a DLL in the file open dialog (fixed in CVS).
<ul>
  <a href="http://wiki.winehq.com/Debugging_the_PE_Explorer_file_open_dialog">
  http://wiki.winehq.com/Debugging_the_PE_Explorer_file_open_dialog</a></ul>
</p><p>
Newbie developers, I crave your feedback. Are these actually useful or am
I wasting my time?</p></quote>
Mike Hearn also had some tips for anyone adding to the wiki:
<quote who="Mike Hearn"><p>
<ul>
<li> Embedding a block of code is best done like this:

<ul><code>
{{{<br />
#!cplusplus<br />
if (foo)<br />
{<br />
<ul><code>
   bar;</code></ul>
}<br />
}}}</code></ul>

 This will give it nice syntax highlighting, a monospace font and line
 numbers.

</li><li> Unfortunately StudlyCaps as the Win32 API uses them is the same style
 that triggers WikiWording. To fix this surround Win32 API names like
 CreateWindow or IShellLink with backticks: eg `IShellLink`. This will
 disable WikiWording in that section and also format them with a
 monospace font.

</li><li> If you have a word that it wants to WikiWord, prefix it with a ! mark.
 Don't do this just because there's no page for it yet, somebody may
 create one in future. Also don't do it for Win32 API names, use
 backticks instead. But it can be useful for some things.</li></ul></p><p>

Those Wine developers who haven't yet made a todo list, go do it! It's
really informative to be able to see what people are working on (not to
mention interesting) and this way we can help cut down on duplication of
effort.</p></quote>

<p>Dimi added to the list:</p>
<quote who="Dimitrie Paun"><p>
<ul>
  <li> if you want to put your email on your page, but are afraid
     of spam, use the MailTo macro like so:
    [[MailTo(dimi AT SPAMFREE lattica DOT com)]]
     This will still show the address properly in the browser, 
    and avoids email harvesting just fine.</li>

  <li> please try to provide a comment when you change a page.
     It takes very little effort (just a few words will do), and helps
     a lot when you look at RecentChanges.</li></ul></p><p>

I'm glad people like the Wiki. It can become an amazing resource,
but only if people contribute and take care of it. I think it's already
on its way to being a great development resource.
</p><p>
If you have any complaints, needs or wants, please don't hesitate
to voice them -- I'd be more than happy to address them.
