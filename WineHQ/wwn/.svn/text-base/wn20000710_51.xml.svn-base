<p />

This is the 51st release of the Wine's kernel cousin
publication. Its main goal is to distribute widely what's
going on around Wine (the Un*x Windows emulator).

<p />

Wilbur Dale unconsciously started an in-depth examination of patches
submission policy with this simple question:

<quote who="Wilbur Dale">
Last week I submitted a patch to the wine-patches list and it did not show up on
the list. 24 hours later I tried again and still no show. I have been receiving
other peoples patches.

<p />

Today I sent a small test patch and it did show up on the list.

<p />

Everything seems to work OK except for my real patch.

<p />

The patch contains example programs including a windows dll and a windows exe.
The net result is the tar file is about 2 meg. Is there a limit set someplace
on the size of an email sent to wine-patches?
</quote>


<p />

First of all, lots of people explained binaries files shouldn't be
included in the source tree: even if CVS accepts binary files (with
the -kb command line option), its diff mechanism is not well suited
(in the tree every binary file evolution is stored, whereas for a text
file, only the diffs are stored leading to a much smaller size, and
also update time). This is the main reason for which every Wine
resource is also stored as a text  unit, and converted when needed to
a binary format (this holds true for bitmaps, cursors, icons...).

<p />

Later on, Wilbur gave some more explanations of his need of binary
files: 
<quote who="Wilbur Dale">
I am writing the HOWTO-winelib. As part of this I want to present examples of
<ol>
	<li />A windows exe using a winelib dll.
	<li />A winelib executable using a windows dll.
	<li />A winelib executable using a winelib dll.
</ol>

<p />

As I see it, I have two choices: either provide binaries or force the user to
use Visual Studio to generate the windows exe and dll files. I think it is
better to provide the binaries with the examples. The point of the examples is
to show how to glue the pieces together. The user may not have Visual Studio.
I think most winelib users will expect the HOWTO and the examples to which it
refers to be in the wine tree. 
</quote>


<p />

Lots of people objected the inclusion of generated executable files
into CVS and asked for some other ways to do it. The most appealing
answer seemed to be: provide only the source files (and generation
scripts, like Makefile:s), and let the user compile the sources. If
this is required, some tarball of all the binaries can be put on the
web (like on www.winehq.org).

<p />

Uwe Bonnes and Ove K&#229;ven also reminded of some tools to generate under
Linux some Windows executables:
<ul>
	<li />Cygwin/Mingw: as native Linux apps	<li />LCC-Win32: run with the help of Wine
	<li />Borland C++ 5.5: command line version available for free
(after registering to Borland users' database)
</ul>

<p />

Francois Gouget was also very astonished to see a 2 MB compressed .tgz 
file for only a small example, and asked how Wilbur got this figure
(and what could explain this huge size - debug information, static
link of some libraries...). It only turned out that Wilbur also
included in the tarball generated files (like config out of config.in
and libtool outputs) which greatly increased the overall size (like
3/4).

<p />

Finally, no one gave an explanation on Wilbur's first question: why
didn't the patches appear on wine-patches list. Well, it seems the
majordomo of the mailing list has an upper limit for the size of a
submission (the limit seems to be below 2 Meg).

<p />

In the heart of another discussion, Jeff Tranter, Project Leader for
Linux Development (Wine team) at Corel, announced:

<quote who="Jeff Tranter">
CorelDRAW and PHOTO-PAINT are now released. It's not our only task,
but we will be working on a merge of our code with WineHQ. We're
starting to plan it now and expect to start in a week or two (a lot of 
people are on vacation right now).
</quote>


<p />

And later on, came the full announcement:
<quote who="Jeff Tranter">
In case you missed the announcement, Corel PHOTO-PAINT is now
available as a free download. The press release can be found at
<a href="http://pcbuyersguide.com/news/pressreleases/PR-Corel%20Photopaint%20for%20Linux.html">
http://pcbuyersguide.com/news/pressreleases/PR-Corel%20Photopaint%20for%20Linux.html</a>

<p />

PHOTO-PAINT, as well as CorelDRAW, were ported to Linux
using WINE. The source code for Corel's version of WINE
is available from <a href="http://opensource.corel.com.">
http://opensource.corel.com/</a>

<p />

Due to tight project schedules, the Corel WINE team
has been working pretty much in isolation for the
last few months. With the graphics release behind us,
we're looking forward to working more closely with
the WINE community. We're really excited about some
of the recent WINE developments (like address space
separation) and want to help WINE move towards a 1.0
release. We will soon be actively working on merging
our WINE changes back to the WineHQ public WINE
source tree. We also hope to contribute where we can
towards the 1.0 WINE release.

<p />

Again our thanks go to all of the WINE developers. The
credits page for our applications list all of the
WINE authors. Without WINE we would not have been
able to port these applications to Linux in such
a short period of time. It's also a testament to the
maturity of WINE (and Linux) that these highly complex
applications run with full functionality and
good performance.

Douglas Ridgway was looking for some volunteers:

<quote who="Doug Ridgway">
If anyone is potentially interested in Wine-related jobs, please let me
know. Please specify your location, and, if relocation is an option, any
restrictions on location.

<p />

Or, if you're interested in hiring, feel free to drop me a line. I'll try
to put you in touch with people who might be appropriate.

<p />

There are also wonderful volunteer positions available:
<ul><li />Run the Wine bug database

<p />

A valuable, important job! And because it's volunteer, you have complete
freedom as to how you do it.

<p />

<li />Graphic redesign for WineHQ

<p />

Make pretty stuff which will be seen by hundreds of thousands of people.
High profile.

<p />

<li />Run the party fund

<p />

Requires an ongoing commitment to partying.
</ul>

<p />

If anyone is interested in taking one of these on, let me know.
</quote>


<p />

Some people expressed interest in the first item, but the last two
remain open. If you feel like doing it, don't hesitate to contact 
<a href="mailto:ridgway@winehq.org">Doug</a>.

<p />

Later on, Jeremy White asked whether it was <quote who="Jeremy White">possible
to formalize this process on WineHQ, perhaps with a mailing list or an
official place for such requests? 

<p />

    Along the same lines, I've been wondering if the Wine community
has a preference for/ideas on working with one of the project sites
(e.g. sourcexchange or cosource)?  I believe that Ove had a positive
experience with CoSource, but AFAIK, there hasn't been any
other successful sponsorship of Wine projects through these sites.

<p />

    We (<i>EdNote: CodeWeavers</i>) would certainly be willing to
sponsor projects listed there, and I'm sure there are many other
people who feel the same way. </quote>

<p />

Doug agreed on the core of the proposal but not on the way to put it
in place:<quote who="Doug Ridgway">A couple of people have suggested
this. However, employment ads are particularly volatile pieces of
information, and they are useless if stale, so you have to make sure
that they are up to date. The big jobs sites do this, along with
providing good search capabilities.

<p /> current size of the industry, it's probably fine for job ads
to just get posted to wine-devel. If the noise gets too high, that will
have to change, but this isn't a danger just yet.
