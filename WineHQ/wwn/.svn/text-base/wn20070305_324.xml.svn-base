<issue num="324" date="03/05/2007" />
<intro> <p>This is the 324th issue of the Wine Weekly News publication.
Its main goal is to have the same great taste, now with real mailing list stats. It also serves to inform you of what's going on around Wine. Wine is an open source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.  Think of it as a Windows compatibility layer.  Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely alternative implementation consisting of 100% Microsoft-free code, but it can optionally use native system DLLs if they are available.

<topic>News</topic>
<p>The big news this week was another Wine snapshot, 0.9.32.  With this
release Alexandre noted improvements in:</p>
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard"><p><ul>
<li> Many Direct3D fixes and performance improvements.</li>
<li> Several new features in the builtin cmd.exe</li>.
<li> Improvements to HTML help support</li>.
</ul></p></quote>


<p>To get a feel for the changes, check out the 
<a href="http://source.winehq.org/ds0.9.32.txt">diff</a>.</p>
<p>In other news, Matthew Newton from PC World (PC World covering Wine?!?!) 
wrote an article this week about Wine, 
<a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/id,129304-page,2-c,linux/article.html">All About Wine: Run Windows Apps Under Linux</a>.
It was fairly well written and it seems like he had pretty good success with
most of the applications he tried.  From the article:</p>
<quote who="Matthew Newton"><p>


To try a more complex application, you'll need its installation file--the 
setup.exe (or equivalent) that puts everything in place. Feed that to Wine on 
the command line. For instance, I decided to try running 2nd Story Software's 
TaxAct Deluxe on Wine this year. (I've used TaxAct for years, figuring that 
since its interface is simpler--that is to say, comes with fewer multimedia 
bells and whistles--than TurboTax and TaxCut, it would play nice with Wine 
sooner than those alternatives. I've been let down every year ... until now.)
</p></quote>

<p>The article is 2 pages long, don't
forget to click the link at the bottom if you want to read the whole thing.</p>

<p>Over at Linux Journal there's an article about 
<a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1000192">VST Plugins</a> for
audio software.  They mention that using some apps that utilize Wine is the
only way to have support for that on Linux right now.  We actually covered
some of that development in WWN a few years ago as those apps were being 
developed.

<topic>DirectX</topic>
<p>Stefan D&#246;singer unleashed another round of DirectX patches.
He announced them on wine-devel and asked for some testing:</p>
<quote who="Stefan Dosinger"><p>
Here is a new patchset for testing which implements duplicating gl contexts 
for new threads in wined3d. Again, it does not implement any synchronisation 
measures (except ENTER_GL and glFinish), so running multithreaded games is 
still kinda a lottery.
</p><p>
This patchset also contains a patch for offscreen rendering, which may fix the 
problems introduced with TES: Oblivion before.
</p><p>
This is just a format-patch of my git tree, the first 3 patches are unrelated. 
One of them is a clone of Henri's already sent patch, and the other 2 patches 
were sent by me already.
</p></quote>

<p>Someone named Mirek tried them out and reported:</p>
<quote who="Mirek"><p><ul>
<li> There are many improvments in some games like Tomb Raider Legends, GTA 
San Andreas, HalfLife Episode One and 3DMark 2005 or 2006</li>
<li> Oblivion is still broken (same as with previous patchset)</li>
<li> With your previous Thread patchset Rainbow Six Vegas can even run to the
menu, but now it hangs while the loading menu.</li>
<li> I can't find any other regressions :)</li></ul>
</p><p>
Tested with:<ul>
<li> 3DMark 2003</li>
<li> 3DMark 2005</li>
<li> 3DMark 2006</li>
<li> Alpine Sky Racing 2007</li>
<li> Battlefield 2142 Demo</li>
<li> Call of Duty 2</li>
<li> Flatout 2</li>
<li> GTA San Andreas</li>
<li> Half-Life 2 EO</li>
<li> NFS: MW</li>
<li> NFS: Carbon (can't run it before and after)</li>
<li> All NVidia SDK Direct3D Demos</li>
<li> Neverwinter Nights 2 (can't run it before and after)</li>
<li> Polda 5 (czech game)</li>
<li> Rayman 3</li>
<li> Rayman Raving Rabbids (can't run it before and after)</li>
<li> Rainbow Six: Vegas</li>
<li> TES IV: Oblivion</li>
<li> Titan Quest (still hangs in menu)</li>
<li> Tomb Raider: Legend</li></ul></p></quote>

<p>Vitaliy Margolen reported success as well:</p>
<quote who="Vitaliy Margolen"><p>
Awesome job! Now several more games that didn't work have started working:<ul>
<li> Indiana Jones and emperor tomb</li>
<li> Prince of Persia Sands of the Time</li>
<li> Psychonauts</li></ul>
</p><p>
All of them were crashing after playing intro video(s). The only finicky
game is Psychonauts. I had to force multi-threaded d3d and even then it
sometimes crashes. Apparently it's the case of thread safety that we
don't have yet.
</p><p>
In general it seems to be a good step forward allowing lots more games to
work on Wine.

	title="MSI OLE Automation Improvements"
	subject="msi ole automation update"
	archive="http://www.winehq.com/pipermail/wine-devel/2007-February/.html"
	posts="2"
>
<topic>RPC / COM / OLE</topic>
<p>OLE automation is a rather high-level API for working with COM
objects.  It allows applications to talk to each other and embed 
functionality from one into another.  It was specifically designed
with scripting languages ni mind and as a result it's very common for Visual
Basic apps to use it.  Wine's compatibility with regards to MSI 
still needs a bunch of attention.
Misha Koshelev announced he had done a lot of work recently in this area:
</p><quote who="Misha Koshelev"><p>
I have been working on some more stuff for the MSI OLE automation, and I
now have a moderately comprehensive conformance test (1000 or so lines,
tests each function implemented at least for basic functionality, tests
things like return codes, if you set a property and then get it do you
get what you set it to, etc.). A few small patches are needed to then
make my OLE automation code (which is still hanging out in wine-patches,
not in git yet) pass this test.
</p><p>
I am going to wait to send all these new patches to wine-patches until
my other patches get reviewed/committed by Alexandre. However, I thought
I would post them here for any comments. I am going to be _quite_ busy
starting Monday for a month though, so I may likely not be able to make
any serious modifications to them if people see large problems until
April. However, if anyone has any comments about these or my patches
already sitting in wine-patches, please do let me know.
</p></quote>

<p>The patches were <a href="http://www.winehq.com/pipermail/wine-devel/2007-March/054559.html">attached</a> 
to the original message.</p>

	title="SoC 2007: HTMLHelp"

<topic>Web/HTML</topic>
<p>Summer of Code ideas are being floated for next summer.  Several
participants who've already worked with Wine are considering doing it
again.  Jacek Caban, the resident Wine web API guru, asked what others
thought of this idea:</p>
<quote who="Jacek Caban"><p>

As you may have noticed, I've been working on HtmlHelp lately. Currently 
it should generally work, but still there is a lot to do. HTML should be 
correctly displayed and content tab should work. I was thinking about 
making more use of it in Wine. I think winecfg could benefit from it. We 
could easily add context help to winecfg using HtmlHelp API. Even just 
integrating a part of Wine User's Guide would be a good start. The main 
problem is building chm file (that is the file format of HtmlHelp). 
Microsoft has a HtmlHelp compiler (hhc) for it. We'd need something 
similar  in Wine. AFAIK there is no good open source replacement. 
HtmlHelp maker (hhc, see [1]) doesn't create internal files (parts of 
chm that describes stuff like index or default topic) and it's GPLed so 
it's useless for Wine (unless author would relicense it for us). I think 
it would be a good project for Google Summer of Code. The task would be 
to write a hhc replacement and add a help option to winecfg. hhc 
replacement (say whhc) would have to be a plain UNIX tool (it means a 
bit of code duplication with itss.dll, just like we do in widl) so we 
could use it during compilation. I think its difficulty is good for SoC. 
Compressing code may be integrated from some other project. The 
remaining parts are code of parser of files describing chm and a little 
winecfg hacking. What do you think?

<p>Bill Medland wanted to know about Fedora Core 4 RPMs:</p>
<quote who="Bill Medland"><p>
Is there any chance that someone with the ability can create the fedora
core 4 wine rpms for version 0.9.30?</p></quote>

<p>Andreas Bierfert, the Fedora package maintainer, said he couldn't
build them any more.  Marcus Meissner, the SuSE package maintainer, 
provided some though:</p>
<quote who="Marcus Meissner"><p>


Fedora Core 4 RPMs are still available in the openSUSE buildservice.
