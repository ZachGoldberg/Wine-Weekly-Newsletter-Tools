<issue num="335" date="12/17/2007" />
<intro> <p>This is the 335 issue of the Wine Weekly News publication.
Its main goal is to  celebrate wine 0.9.51. It also serves to inform you of what's going on around Wine. Wine is an open source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.  Think of it as a Windows compatibility layer.  Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely alternative implementation consisting of 100% Microsoft-free code, but it can optionally use native system DLLs if they are available.   You can find more info at <a href="http://www.winehq.org">www.winehq.org</a></p> </intro>

	title="HLSL/GLSL and DX10"

<topic>DirectX</topic>
<p>So, this may be a different type of post for the WWN; I'm going to go for some educational content related to Wine.  I was reading the devel the other day when I stumbled upon <a href="http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2007-December/061061.html">this thread</a>.  It seemed really interesting, DX10 stuff, shaders; all really cool.  But what the heck is HLSL and GLSL?  I could only half make sense of the actual conversation!</p>
<p>
So, a bit of background on these funky acronyms before we dive into the thread itself (Most of the info from <a href="http://wikipedia.org">wikipedia</a></p>
<quote><p>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GLSL">GLSL</a> (Open<b>GL</b> <b>S</b>hading <b>L</b>anguage): also known as GLslang, is a high level shading language based on the C programming language. It was created by the OpenGL ARB to give developers more direct control of the graphics pipeline without having to use assembly language or hardware-specific languages.
</p></quote>
<p>
Essentially, when programmers want a certain effect on some pixels they can write small little programs that run on the GPU (shaders) which take a group of pixels, or a region of the screen and run some code on it. 
</p>
<quote><p>
Shaders are used to allow a 3D application designer to program the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) "programmable pipeline", which has mostly superseded the older "fixed-function pipeline", allowing more flexibility in making use of advanced GPU programmability features.
</p></quote>
<p>
The issue is that writing shaders can often be complicated and difficult.  So GLSL was born, a higher level shading language to hopeuflly make programming these things easier.  HLSL is another lanuage, similar to GLSL, from Microsoft; and the translation of HLSL to something workable with Linux/BSD etc. will be necessary to continue WineD3D.  How this will happen is the subject of this wine devel discussion:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
hlsl2glsl is the good solution for implementing shaders on directX 10.
Nevertheless, the hlsl compilation to tokens has to be done for d3d9. On
the other hand, if we implement d3dx9_xx, it is likely that the
application will be using the compile D3DX9CompileShader to get the
tokens. Currently it works and we can use the libraries d3dx9_xx and get
good results but the following transformations:<br />
1. HLSL is compiled to tokens<br />
2. Tokens are transformed to GLSL.<br />
<br />
...<br />
<br />
The aim would not be to gain compilation time but to be more loyal to the
source HLSL. The final executable instead of making exactly what the ASM
is meant to do, it would make exactly what the HLSL is meant to do and
probably would be more optimized for the particular system.
HLSL --> Tokens --> GLSL  --> Executable that performs the actions of the
tokens
HLSL --> GLSL --> Executable that performs the actions of the HLSL.
<br /><br />
Furthermore, taking into consideration the need of HLSL2GLSL for DirectX 10,
the hlsl2glsl will have to be set anyway. Therefore, the code needs are
not so big but just leaving the door open.
What do you all think and in particular David?
</p>
</quote>
<p>
H. Verbeet responds that HLSL2GLSL might actually not be as useful as it seems:
</p>
<quote><p>
[...], you'll need a proper implementation of the SM 4.0
implementation either way, because D3D10 still allows binary shaders,
and I expect the majority of games to ship those instead of actual
source. So it would be an additional path that needs to be maintained,
and the most feasible way to implement it I've heard so far would be
to embed GLSL code a comment section inside the shader byte code,
which would be rather ugly.<br /><br />
<br /><br />
And finally, the actual hardware has it's own hardware specific
language for shaders. HLSL or D3D bytecode isn't really any closer to
the actual hardware language than GLSL or ARB asm, so it isn't even
guaranteed to gain us much.
</p></quote>
<p>Stefan Dosinger writes in with further information on the DX10 Pipeline:</p>
<quote><p>

Keep in mind that getting shaders translated into GLSL, which we can then send
to the card, is only a small part of the whole dx10 topic. We will need our
own codepath anyway(HLSL -> d3d asm -> GLSL). We have to investigate wether a
direct HLSL -> GLSL path will gain us any performance. We can optimize the
HLSL -> d3d asm ourselves, and the d3d asm->GLSL->card native code is
lossless in theory. If the GLSL compiler is good, then it will recognise the
assembler instructions in our GLSL code and essentially we have d3d asm ->
card native then.
</p><p>
We will have to investigate what we gain with a 2nd direct HLSL->GLSL
translation. I think we won't gain anything, and the effort is better spent
elsewhere.

<topic>Process List</topic>
<p>
Gonzalo Martinez writes in with an interesting query about whether or not wine can change its name in the process list (ps).  This seems like a great idea, and immediatly caught my attention:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
Hello to all.<br />
<br />
I have something in mind that I would like to ask to Wine developers.
Is it possible using a hack/trick or a hidden option to change the  
name of wine in the proccess lists?
I mean, Is it possible to list 'wine' proccess as, for example  
'iexplorer' when I use Internet Explorer under Wine?
<br />
Thanks a lot for your work, hope my question find the answer here.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
Apparently this had been thought up of before:  Stefan Dosinger writes in:
</p>
<p><quote>
This is done since quite some time. apps are usually called "iexplore.exe", or 
they have the name of the file that was passed to wine, like C:\Program 
Files\Internet Explorer\iexplore.exe

If you still see "wine", "wineloader" or something similar you have a very 
outdated version of wine.
</quote>
</p>
<p>
Apparently, this already existed!  Alright, so whats the deal?  Apparently it only works on linux!  Poor Gonzalo is on FreeBSD.  Stefan writes in with the unfortunate news:
</p>
<quote><p>
Ow, ah, this is a different business. I think we use some Linux-only feature
to set the name, and Alexandre told me that at least MacOS doesn't have it. I
have no idea if there is a way to change the process name under BSD. If there
is, feel free to implement it and send a patch
</p></quote>
<p>
There are of course ways to do this on FreeBSD, Alex Juillard lets us know that it may be possible:
</p>
<quote><p>
I wouldn't [accept a hack which involves copying the process to /tmp], but on FreeBSD you can use setproctitle() for this.
</p></quote>
<p>
Another important point brought up later in this thread, is that its not wise to killall wineserver or killall explorer.exe.  Its much smarter to "wineserver -k".  L Rahyen writes:
</p>
<quote><p>
wineserver -k
<br /><br />
       This kills all processes which belongs to current WINE prefix (as specified
in WINEPREFIX environment variable or ~/.wine otherwise). For me this works
in 100% of cases so I see no problem here.

<p>
There was some discussion this week as to why some applications seem to get removed from the AppDB after they get 'stale'.  Richard S wrote in with some concern:
</p>
<quote><p>
Hi
<br /><br />
Im one of the maintainers of the iTunes 6.x (was)
<br /><br />
On Saturday I received this email
<br /><br />
'
Subject: 	[AppDB] Version '6.x' of 'iTunes' deleted<br />
Date: 	Sat, 08 Dec 2007 12:15:45 -0600 (18:15 GMT)<br />

Version '6.x' of 'iTunes' deleted<br />
-------------------------------------------------------<br />
The action was performed by Wesley Hamel<br />
Reasons given<br />

'<br /><br />

Is it standard practice to remove all old versions of a program except for the
most recent?
<br /><br />
IF this is true, WHY?
<br /><br />
Rich
</p></quote>
<p>This indeed doesn't seem to make sense; alas we recieve the voice of reason and policy.  Bryan Haskins writes:</p>
<quote><p>
It really depends on the case, if a program is entirely superseded by
another version, ie you can't use the old version at all anymore, totally.
If it's still entirely possible to use an older version, and people have a
reason too, I would personally not delete it. However it really is up to the
management of the maintainers, and how they want to handle things.
</p></quote>
<p>
Hm, this makes sense.  However, it still appears the iTunes removal was unnecessary.  Alex Sornes explains:
</p>
<quote><p>
That's correct.  If a version is not usable anymore (because it connects to a 
server etc.) it can be made obsolete so votes will be moved to a usable one.
<br /><br />
We are in the process of adding an un-delete system to the AppDB so issues 
like the recent ones can be fixed.
