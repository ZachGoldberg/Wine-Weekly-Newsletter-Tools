There has been a lot going on, as always, with Wine lately and sadly also in the WWN editor's life.  I was recently contacted by several Wine community members who expressed a desire to have regularly posted AppDB/BugZilla stats, even if I am unable to put together a full WWN with news articles.  This seemed like an entirely reasonable request and so I have made a commitment to myself to ensure that at least one WWN is posted during each Wine release cycle.  With any luck we'll also see some news stories in these releases!

Thats all for now, enjoy the stats!<br />
