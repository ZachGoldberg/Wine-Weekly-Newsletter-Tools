Missed a spot? Don't forget to use the correct function names for the

This would be welcome, I have had "DirectInput - Implement missing

This is not something within GSOC scope in my opinion, I expect you will
need 6 weeks alone to get up to speed with the concepts of msi and patching.

In general I think it's better to identify a small set of APIs to implement
or improve instead of aiming for a broad goal like "improving .net 3.5",
which is hard to quantify and more likely to fail.

Subject: Working on "DOS" VGA.
Message-ID: <4BB456A9.7000202@tdcadsl.dk>

Hi Wine-devel

My name is Morten and I would like for some of my old DOS/WIN95 games to 
work with wine. :)

I know that I most likely could solve this by using DOSbox and/or DOSemu.
But I don't consider either of them user friendly in it's raw form.
And I hope in the future it could be more of a Go to this menu item, 
click a few choices and then play game thing.

So I have been looking into what one of them is needing (XCOM Apocalypse).

The first thing that needs work is the VGA screen driver. The game needs 
one of the unsupported video modes.
After looking further into it, I can see that the current screen driver, 
needs to be more of an emulator than just a copy of the framebuffer/RAM 
window  to/from the DirectDraw surface.

But since I need to do a lot rewrite of the code, to get a emulator into 
things,  I would of course like to test all the stuff that I don't touch 
(in term of videomodes). But there isn't a test catalog in 
dlls/krnl386.exe16. That could of course be due to the fact that it is 
pretty hard to write test for that old platform and get proper test on a 
live version.
Or am I missing something here?

Looking over the list of videomodes, I can see that a lot of them says 
supported.
Is that really true or do they simply not break?
Again is there anyway to test that those modes are truely supported in 
my code change (and in the current code)?

Another problem that I am facing at a later stage is that most of the 
games needs to be installed in win95 mode.
But I think that most people will run with something like XP, Vista or 
Win7 as default mode.
That will break most of the old installers as DOS version becomes 5.0 or 
something "silly" like that.
So I am thinking about having to create a wrapper program where you can 
install your old programs through so the mode gets set correctly during 
install. And perhaps also creates some proper shortcuts in the menu.
And perhaps even into the new game database that new windows version have.
And thoughts/ideas on this?

Another way to handle this would be to do something like a MD5 on the 
install.exe (hoping that they differ) and then look up in the AppDB, to 
see which mode to use as installer mode (and run mode). Yes, that would 
most likely require changes to AppDB. But I can see a use for this even 
for the above wrapper program (Autodetect using AppDB).

Once I get a new VGA "driver" running, I will most likely start looking 
into INT10h and others that try to interface to the VGA "driver".

Best Regards
Morten R?nne

Hi Vitaliy & Marcus,
this is unfortunately misunderstanding. I'm bit old for being a student
although i remember for university studies with love...

So i could not even qualify for GSoC and also my coding skills are pretty
bad (probably none, in front of yours). The initial email was meant
as proposal, if there would be volunteer who do not know what to do
or his ideas were too high for GSoC, so some of the mentor could him
offer this "DirectInput job".

Sorry for noise - i was not aware, that there is a page http://wiki.winehq.org/SummerOfCode
which has all the needed "jobs".

W.

Hi Morten,

First of all welcome to Wine. Myself I'm a bit worried about whether
we should improve our DOS support even further. The problem is that
more and more people are moving over to 64-bit Linux. While you can
run 32-bit programs on a 64-bit system, there is no protected mode
support (vm86; there is emulation in some cases using a kernel
module). I don't know all the details about what works and not but I
fear the 64-bit move makes DOS support in Wine not that useful these
days but I might be wrong.

You might as well call arbfp_blit_set() directly.

This does quite a bit more than just renaming things. More
importantly, these implementations will now claim that blits with
destination fixups are supported, while they aren't.

You should pass an appropriate pool (i.e., WINED3DPOOL_DEFAULT) in
CheckSurfaceCapability(), and I don't think passing NULL for the
destination format makes a lot of sense for blits.

I already commented on some issues with 0007 and 0008 since you
already submitted those. As for the general direction, I think you're
still trying to take fairly large steps. E.g., it's much easier to
first introduce things like arbfp_blit_supported() and
arbfp_blit_surface() as a separate functions, work them out properly
for each implementation, and only then add them to the blitter
interface. (I think I mentioned that before.) That's much nicer to
review too, since I wouldn't be reviewing 3 or 4 different things at
the same time.

I didn't look too close at this one due to the reasons mentioned
above, but my general feeling is that it may need some more work.
(Beyond what I already mentioned in the reply to that patch.)

You could also try something like introducing a function to the
blitter interface to set color key information. I don't think this is
the most important thing to worry about at this point though, so it's
ok to leave it where it is for the moment. Note that that does imply
that you can't have BLIT_OP_COLOR_KEYED_BLIT either yet.

I think surface.c is ok. The reason it's in device.c is mostly historic.

My feeling was that we only want to use arbfp_blit for complex fixups
and identity fixups are better suited for fbo_blit/ffp_blit.

fbo_blit doesn't exist yet here, and may be unavailable depending on
available extensions or ORM used. You pretty much never want to use
ffp_blit if you can help it, due to the huge amount of state
invalidation that does.

Of course arbfp_blit is somewhat broken in the sense that it doesn't
actually create a shader for non-complex fixups and silently lets
ffp_blit handle the blit, but that's something that should be fixed,
not disabled.

There's protected mode 32 bit, protected mode 16 bit, but no vm86 16 bit. So no real mode apps in Wine. We'd need to integrate a CPU emulator or JIT compiler into Wine to get this working.

There are a surprising big number of Win95 area apps that have an installer that starts off in vm86 mode...

Security people would love that! That way Wine won't ever need to be
able to mmap address 0x00000000.

Hello,

Could you clear a little what do you mean under "stop abusing"?
I've removed incorrect usage of constness in declaration for the variable  
that is changed for sure.
I've send "try 2" patch with additional correction and extended log

Please check it.

Subject: Mono integration
Message-ID: <s2gced95fe1004010914kd39d73f2ia4c6c1103b7a117c@mail.gmail.com>

I wrote a wiki page yesterday about the current state of Mono
integration in Wine and what I think needs to be done about it. That
is at: http://wiki.winehq.org/Mono

Basically, if you install Mono in Wine, Wine will use it to run .NET
programs. However, the combination doesn't work for any of the
programs I've tried. There are a number of things wrong (listed on the
wiki page), but none of them appear to affect a lot of programs.

My theory is that it just happens to not work very well because of
random bugs. I think it's important that we improve this, so that we
have an alternative to MS .NET. I am amazed that the licensing allows
us to use MS .NET now (if indeed it really does), and I don't know how
long that will continue.

So here is what I'd like to ask from the community:

* Try some .NET programs with Mono (use the mono26 verb in
winetricks), and file Wine bugs when they don't work. Even if the bug
is in Mono, we should investigate it and give them a nice report,
since we are using Mono in a strange way. Use the dotnet keyword.

* If an installer for something other than .NET tries to install .NET,
file a bug for that with the dotnet keyword.

* Someone other than me, please try to make a Windows build of Mono
and run the Mono test suite under Wine. I want to make sure that the
instructions make sense and that someone other than me can do this.

For any .Net version (1.1, 2.0, 3.5)? Does that also count for service
packs? I take it your recent work on mscoree should fake a dotnet
installation?

I'll try to do that this in the next few days/weekend.

Any .NET version. Mono 2.6 supports all of those (see
http://www.mono-project.com/Compatibility).

My work on mscoree so far has done basically nothing. There is a
Dotnet section in wine.inf that installs some registry keys that
satisfy some installers.

Thanks for the input, Hans. Looking back at previous GSOC proposals,
many of them were "Improve x" (see
http://wiki.winehq.org/SummerOfCode/PreviousProjects).

As far as the issue of quantification, I think it's pretty easy to say
"if .NET 3.5 installs, that's a success. If applications that require
.NET 3.5 run (or aren't blocked by anything .NET), that's a success."
Hell, even if I don't get .NET to install -- so long as I've made
progress on it and it makes it that much easier for another developer,
I'd call that a success.

The issue of difficulty is something I've thought about. As I've
mentioned, I don't have any Wine-specific experience so I am not well
able to gauge how reasonable a given project is.

I'm hearing very mixed opinions on some of them so I think at this
point my best bet is to submit several proposals for projects I'm
interested in and then do my best to see whichever is accepted through
(if it is even accepted). I remember reading somewhere that as long as
I work hard, not completely meeting my goals would not be an issue.
Given that, I'd rather set the bar high as I think that would be
better motivation.

Again, thanks to everyone for their input. I will submit the proposals
I have written and will probably write/submit a few more.

The compatibility information basically indicates that Mono can substitute
for .NET below version 3.0. 3.0 and higher still needs Microsoft's
implementation.

How would you handle hybridizing Mono with Microsoft's framework?

If you want to do something in the .NET area perhaps some work can be
done on Mono integration (see the mono topic Vincent started) and the
wiki (http://wiki.winehq.org/Mono).

You would need different wine prefixes if you want to use both at once.

What is the problem with 3.0, and can't it be fixed?

AFAIK mono doesn't implement WPF,  so any .NET app that uses it is likely to
fail in mono. Correct me if i'm wrong

This is true, and according to
http://www.mono-project.com/Compatibility they have no plans to
implement it. But someone could, and even if the mono project doesn't
want it, it would be useful for Wine.

I mean your new origProtoRef variable (which BTW uses a completely
different naming convention from the rest of the function) to work
around the fact that the argument is modified. Much better to use a
properly named local variable to store results and not modify the
argument.

Perhaps there are some apps which mix .NET and win32 (I mean mixing in
a nice way and not overriding wndproc and evil stuff). Years ago
Paint.NET was ported over to Mono. I don't remember what they did but
I guess they mainly removed some win32isms. The code to paint.net used
to be available (I think the 3.0 source still is). You could check if
it is a well behaving .NET app which uses win32. Getting Paint.NET
working on mono+wine could be a good test case. Note since both of you
are in MSP that might have advantages as well.

DOSBox does something like this already.  I lack ideas about to what 
extent DOSBox could be integrated, but at least its CPU emulator could do.  
Or maybe DOSBox could even be bridged/integrated and do all the DOS stuff 
here?

Then IIRC there were discussions in the past about integrating Qemu into 
Wine.  Some folks at Darwine have achieved this to some degree: [1]

That probably won't fly directly [2] but some aspects of the design of an 
emulator integration can be investigated already, IMHO.

that's the point I wanted to be clarified
did you check what mciGetDeviceID("all") returns on Vista or XP ?
if it's 0xFFFF in all cases, the real answer is then that device ID are 
internally UINT16 and we shouldn't care at all about 32 bit extension
it it's 0xFFFFFFFF in latest windows, then likely the device ID has been 
extended internally, and we should cope with both 0xFFFF and 0xFFFFFFFF 
values in winmm

but does

SYSINFO_PARMS.wDeviceType = (WORD)(DWORD)MCI_ALL_DEVICE_ID;
work better ?
if yes, I'd be convinced for a bug in native winmm, missing a (WORD) cast somewhere...

actually there are not magic offsets, but can be computed from the 
previous values written. the current parser can be better rewritten in a 
way were fields are written to in sequential order (currently, for 
example, return values are written at the end, which is not satisfactory)
but I agree current that current parser can be improved

MCI_OPEN is kinda specific
the others are not.
it just uses that first parameter is callback, second is the returned 
type (which is described in the MCI table), then parameters, which are 
also described in the table. no nothing magic here

to me what works are test (and packing) of MCI structures on 64 windows 
(but with native DLLs, hence using native MCI tables)
what doesn't work is MCI parser (with builtin winmm) and same MCI structures
but we never validated builtin MCI tables on windows...

we just need a copy of 64bit winmm.dll. If someone could mail it to me 
privately, it would be rather easy to check.

While this has the advantage of being an area where no one has done
any serious work yet (and therefore, there is likely low-hanging
fruit), I don't know how you could focus this so that the scope is
clear and it is easily quantified.

I also don't have a sense yet of what working on Mono in Wine is like.
I'm still a Mono noob, as I've done no real development there.

I think that something useful could come out of such a project, but I
cannot predict what.

Just my 2 phennings worth on this...
Why reinvent the wheel... I would say instead of doing the emulator inside wine... or a JIT... why not have
wine intersept the call to start the vm86 mode.. and forks off and starts DOSEMU or whatever DOS box system is
configured.. That way wine doesnt have to worry about it...

Like the part about world domination.  However, that will have to wait
for Linux/MacOSX to be the OS of choice.  :)

AFAIK we can't integrate with DOSBox, Dosemu or FreeDOS for the same
reason we can't integrate with Samba: their GPL licence.

QEMU's CPU core library however is LGPL (http://wiki.qemu.org/License)
just like Wine - but in my experience QEMU is very slow when it does
full emulation.

If that's really what you want, you need to add this function to
wined3d_private.h. Right now it will generate a warning. Perhaps it
should just be in surface.c though? This function depends on having an
active context. Where is "palette_texture" deleted?

But you don't know all that. All you know is that you've got two
surfaces with certain properties. You could argue that since the
source and destination fixups are the same they cancel out, so that
you can do that blit as long as you either don't stretch or the fixup
is linear. However, in that case you also need to make sure the
blitter actually behaves like that.

I am profane at licensing, but does GPL restrict even usage of binary 
(linking, execution), or only a compilation of source code?

Should not be slower that eg. BOCHS.

I must say that I'm not happy with the piece of code myself. The
problem is that the P8 code has more or less behaved like this the
past couple of years and yes that was bad and I don't think all
ugliness can be fixed one step.

The check in blt_supported is not so great and I'm not sure if it can
be improved well. If blit_supported had access to the source and
destination surface, it could just check if they are the same which
would handle the needs of corner cases like RealizePalette and
LoadLocation. RealizePalette doesn't really care about whether a blit
is supported at all, it just wants to know if p8 conversion is done by
the gpu, so it can call LoadLocation texture->drawable else
LoadLocation is called to perform a sysmem->(surface_conversion
texture->) drawable upload. The callers (LoadLocation) do care, since
they have to perform conversion or not (it is fun how the conversion
is entangled with the blit_shader). The main reason for not passing
surfaces to blit_supported was because of CheckSurfaceCapability and
CheckDeviceFormat which don't have access to them and need a sort
'color_fixup_supported'. Perhaps we should have two calls one which
works on pools/flags and one which works on surfaces (and which just
extracts the info and passes it to the other one)?

Another slightly related issue is d3dfmt_get_conv. Right now it loads
format info from the formats_table. The formats table contains opengl
extension checks and based on this sets the formats for the arbfp p8
shader or the ffp paletted_texture code. Perhaps we should ask the
blit_shader (once you know that it supports a certain blit) about the
format.  and so now and then afor  P8_UINT. The blit_shader can fall
back to d3dfmt_get_conv (or the formats table) when it doesn't perform
an override. The same could be done for color keying but the main
issue is that you don't know for what purpose you arrived in
LoadLocation, so asking the blit_shader won't make sense all cases.

> However, in that case you also need to make sure the

Even before the ongoing rewrites this is basically how the P8 code
behaved. At some point the yuv fixups were added and then FIXMEs about
destination fixups appeared because the p8 code didn't receive a
rewrite yet. The blit_supported code works fine for p8 source -> p8
render_target while the p8 framebuffer -> texture path is quite broken
(I'm quite sure the fb_copy_ ones don't work; not sure about FBO;
read_from_framebuffer works though). But I think the framebuffer ->
texture code should be killed since I don't think we should advertise
P8 textures at all. This would only leave p8 source -> p8
render_target destination fixups and LoadLocation.

This was a long mail (hope you can make sense of it). To summarize the
P8 check in blit_supported is so ugly (and it might not work in all
cases) for a part due to CheckSurfaceCapability and CheckDeviceFormat.
I think that if I would kill the P8 texture support it might take away
your concerns. While I would like to keep the problem as simple as
possible I fear that some parts of d3dfmt_get_conv already need a
rewrite at this point since it is starting to make life difficult. The
main concern is how to perform surface conversion when needed and the
color keying (though for that a special location flag could work as
you suggested before).

I'm not a lawyer, but my understanding of the license is that you
cannot in general link to GPL code without making the whole binary
fall under GPL. The LGPL allows a program to link to it without
affecting the license of the program, though.

You can however have your non-GPL code execute a separate GPL binary
without affecting the legal state of your own code. The important part
is that the programs are kept separate.

Can't you handle P8 -> P8 blits as regular ARGB -> ARGB blits as long
as you don't stretch? I.e., compared to this patch the main difference
would be that you don't set the P8 -> ARGB shader at all in that case.
This would be generic for all complex fixups as long as we don't
stretch, and for simple / linear fixups even with stretching.

Only slightly related, I think it's reasonable to require non-NULL
source / destination rectangles for internal interfaces. I.e., handle
NULL rectangles in the public wined3d entry points, but just require
them to be non-NULL everywhere else.

You don't want a W->A->W conversion for the command line, that's why
these programs are Unicode in the first place.

Because you can mix modes in one executable. Take for example the average modern dos game: They start as real mode apps, then switch to a 32 bit protected mode dos extender(e.g. dos4gw.exe). I wouldn't be surprised if the app can transform itself into a Win16 app that tries to pop up a window. Wouldn't work well in Linux dosemu.

What may work better however is using a Win32 dosemu binary to load the app. Then we just have to make sure that windows dosemu can deal with such mixed apps.

P8 -> P8 blits could be handled as ARGB->ARGB blits. Another
alternative would be to disable opengl p8->p8 blits and perform the
blit in software. It would then follow the same route as LockRect
through LoadLocation. I would say that a software blit is more
efficient than a software P8->ARGB conversion but if the app doesn't
reload the source contents frequently, it would be more efficient if
it stays on the GL side. This is more a ddraw-gl redesign point. In
games like Jedi Knight, C&C and others this would save a lot of
framebuffer read backs if GL is used.

Regarding the non-NULL rects it is what I'm trying to move to.
BltOverride doesn't really rely on it anymore (the surface_get_rect
lines can be moved back to its callers).

This is a patch that has mscoree.dll load mono.dll in-process rather
than starting mono.exe. This is needed so that (among other things),
the running process gets the correct values from GetCommandLine and
GetModuleFileName(0).

The code quality is probably not very good, so I'm sending it to
wine-devel for feedback first.

For what it's worth when I've approached Novel people they've been quite 
open to the idea of greater cooperation with the Wine project.  I think 
we can benefit greatly if we made it very clear what Wine wants from 
Mono, and especially what paid Novell people won't be doing (and thus 
needs to be done by the community).

Thank you for starting that wiki page, it's a great step in that direction.

Thanks,

I don't know almost anything about embedding mono, but I've reviewed 
your patch. It mostly looks good for me, so my comments are more 
suggestions than real problems.

+static LPWSTR get_mono_path(DWORD major_version, DWORD minor_version, LPCWSTR subpath)

AFAICS you don't use *_version arguments, so they should be removed.

+    size = len + sizeof(slash) + (lstrlenW(subpath) + 1) * sizeof(WCHAR);
      if (!(ret = HeapAlloc(GetProcessHeap(), 0, size))) return NULL;

      lstrcpyW(ret, root);
      lstrcatW(ret, slash);
-    lstrcatW(ret, mono_exe);
+    lstrcatW(ret, subpath);

It's not really important as it only causes the buffer to be one char too big, but you count nullbyte both in sizeof(slash) and strlen+1. (It's already existing code and a matter of style, but strcat for one char doesn't look nice).

+static LPWSTR get_mono_exe(void)
+{
+    static const WCHAR mono_exe[] = {'b','i','n','\\','m','o','n','o','.','e','x','e',' ',0};
+
+    return get_mono_path(0, 0, mono_exe);
+}

You don't use this function, so it should be removed.

+        mono_dll_path = get_mono_path(0, 0, mono_dll);
+        if (!mono_dll_path) goto end;
+
+        mono_bin_path = get_mono_path(0, 0, bin);
+        set_environment(mono_bin_path);
+
+        mono_lib_path = get_mono_path(0, 0, lib);
+        mono_etc_path = get_mono_path(0, 0, etc);

Each get_mono_path performs a few registry operations. It feels right to fetch the path once and simply concatenate subdirs later.

+        current_arg += WideCharToMultiByte(CP_UTF8, 0, argvw[i], -1, current_arg, size, NULL, NULL);

size is not the right size here, but it's not really important as there won't be an overflow anyway.

+    trace_size = GetEnvironmentVariableA("WINE_MONO_TRACE", trace_setting, sizeof(trace_setting)/sizeof(WCHAR));

      if (trace_size)
      {
-        lstrcatW(cmd_line, trace_switch_start);
-        lstrcatW(cmd_line, trace_setting);
-        lstrcatW(cmd_line, trace_switch_end);
+        mono_jit_set_trace_options(trace_setting);

This should probably go to separated patch.

Error handling in _CorExeMain could be improved.

+/* Mono 2.6 embedding */
+typedef struct _MonoDomain MonoDomain;
+typedef struct _MonoAssembly MonoAssembly;
+
+extern HMODULE mono_handle;
+
+extern void (*mono_config_parse)(const char *filename);
+extern MonoAssembly* (*mono_domain_assembly_open) (MonoDomain *domain, const char *name);
+extern void (*mono_jit_cleanup)(MonoDomain *domain);
+extern int (*mono_jit_exec)(MonoDomain *domain, MonoAssembly *assembly, int argc, char *argv[]);
+extern MonoDomain* (*mono_jit_init)(const char *file);
+extern int (*mono_jit_set_trace_options)(const char*  options);
+extern void (*mono_set_dirs)(const char *assembly_dir, const char *config_dir);

Most of these (all?) are not needed outside mscoree_main.c so they should be static.

You can't remove this part. We don't want to pass "wine:" prefix to 
set_wine_url.

+    }else if(strncmp(spec, "ftp:", 4)
+            || strncmp(spec, "http:", 5)
+            || strncmp(spec, "https:", 6)) {

After removing is_wine_url, the else part should be always executed.

According to the Mono page here (
http://www.mono-project.com/Mono_Project_Roadmap#Unsupported_technologies ),
the Mono project isn't adverse to having work done to implement WPF, WCF,
and WF, but they currently don't have an inclination to do so.

The question is, are there people in the Wine community skilled in .NET to
bring these technologies to Wine through Mono?

Message-ID: <j2zcca4675d1004022308x1959003er94794e485251b98c@mail.gmail.com>

hello sir,
    i am nitheesh.k.l. i am a second year engineering student of computer
science studying in PES institute of technology,Bangalore,India. in this
summer i'm willing to participate in the google summer of code and i was
really interested in your idea to solve the vga display modes problem in
wine.
    i work on both windows and linux and previously used to work in dos. i
do most of my work in linux and i use wine to run some of my dos and windows
programs. but for a long time now i'm not able to run some of my dos
programs properly in wine. i've tried my ways but was not successful.since
people in wine have come forward to solve this i feel that i can work with
you guys to solve the problem.

my experience:
    as  mentioned before i used to work on dos and done some work in it.

1)    i written some small system diagnostics tools. the first is the ports
diagnostics tool.it helps the user to check whether his ports are working
fine or not.
    it includes both serial and parallel port and checks for all the baud
rated. it provides both software loop back and hardware tests for user
satisfaction, and         it also comes with an simple and attractive gui.
    i've also implemented a small tool just like norton utilities(NU in
dos)which is about 75% complete(could not complete as my exams started)
2)    i've also worked on building an editor in dos and as my part in it
i've created the gui for the editor.
    i've also designed a gui for an antivirus in dos
3)    last summer i developed some small games for some of the problems in
computer science of which the towers of hanoi is the major one.
    it has a gui which displays the disks of various sizes and the pegs to
move them around.it initially ask for the number of disk and once the
specified number of disks are created the user can then move them around
using the arrow keys to complete the solution. my major intention in
developing this is that the     younger students can use this to understand
the problem and its solution in a fun and enjoyable way.
4)    As a hobby ive also developed a software to burn the hex file to a
microcontroller. it has a very user friendly user interface(similar to turbo
c++) through which the user can select the required file and then dump it to
the device.it provides support for two major microcontroller used in our
college. the software displays the complete hex file,its ascii equivalent
and the actual hex code that runs on the device.


i feel that since i've worked on both platforms and personally experienced
the problem, i can and am interested in fixing the bugs. so with this
experience am i eligible to work with you in this years gsoc. if so then
i'll send my application immediately.i kindly request you to reply sir.

thank you.
Nitheesh

Hi Nitheesh,
it does sound like DOS is near and dear to your heart.

What's the first small problem you would solve?  Sending
a good patch for that would be an eloquent way of framing
your proposal.

DOS apps can't do that. Pretty much the only thing you really have to
share is the filesystem, and it should be easy to configure DosBox to
mount ~/.wine/drive_c, and to invoke Wine when a DOS app starts a
Windows binary.

There's no reason to replicate DosBox inside Wine. On the contrary, a
nice project would be to improve integration with an external DOS
emulator and then rip out the half-broken vm86 support from Wine.

As far as attribution goes, it was originally done by Jennifer Lai. My patch is more or less bringing these patches up to the current code.

I am curious why these patches weren't applied in the first place.

He means each post to wine-patches should fix just one bug.
http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9850 is a bad
bug report, really; it needs to be broken up into individual
bugs, and then a clean patch sent for each.

But Win16 applications can access DOS int 0x21 functions (below,
tested successfully on Wine and Vista), and at least some hardware
(http://www.faqs.org/faqs/windows/programming/vxd/ describes how a
Win16 application can access the VGA framebuffer). Doesn't that mean
we need the vm86 support in Wine?

Yes, but those INT21 calls are in Win16 protected mode, not DOS real mode.

And VXD ... I doubt anything uses it.

Back in the Win95 era, I remember libnet having a DOS network driver that 
hooked into winsock.vxd. It allowed a DOS app (compiled with DJGPP) to use 
Windows' winsock driver when run under Windows. I remember that because I 
thought it was the best thing ever, since I only had DJGPP and wasn't 
interested in Win32 programming (and even if I could, I don't think MinGW was 
around, yet).

But beyond that, couldn't a pure DOS app launch a Win32 exe, and have that 
program run like a normal Windows app? How would that work if the app is run 
under DOSBox or similar?

how seamless could the integration be made?
I've seen a number of programs (mainly installers) and also guilty of
writing a few win apps that shell out a dos call and return to continue.
Also while wine seems to encourage a spread of apps to work, the core DosBox
guys have made it clear they are only interested retro games. So dosemu or a
qemu/bochs co-operation may be more fruitful.

The command prompt in windows works similar to DOS but it is not DOS.
Things which invoke our command prompt should still work (well, win9x
/ nt4.0 stuff might depend on real DOS stuff though).

Dosbox is available for all platforms and is relatively light. While
they focus mostly on games, they aren't against general fixes. Dosemu
is Linux specific but qemu/bochs would also be possible. Personally
I'm in favor of Dosbox.

You'll want to make a formal proposal on http://socghop.appspot.com/gsoc/.

One other thing you may want to aim for is better windows support. It
should be possible to run appinstall in windows under cygwin (it
should be pretty easy to fix, actually).

Message-ID: <1270457123.2322.13.camel@putamadre>

Hi all,

  I took some time this morning to rebase tdavenport's gst/dshow branch
against current master and added my comments/reviews in the last commit.

  The branch can be found here :
http://github.com/bilboed/wine/tree/tdaven-rebased

  I'm putting this out so that if any student is interested, he could
carry on this work during GSOC.

  The current status is that using gstreamer as a backend for dshow has
been proven to work within a very limited use-case.

  What remains:
  * Making it more efficient, flexible and lightweight (see all my
comments)
  * Allowing it to automatically pick up whatever GStreamer element is
available on the system and make it available through dshow.

  A good goal for example would be to make the various audio/video
gstreamer sinks available through dshow (for example picking up the
pulse sink), and the various audio/video decoders.
  Having it working with a native windows application (pick a player or
an audio/video app using dshow) would be a must.

  Don't hesitate to ask questions/comments,

    Edward

Thanks for the update. I have also updated the gsoc proposal list at
our wiki, to point at this mail. Hopefully someone will pick it up as
this would be a really useful project in my opinion.

Please add a test case for this.

Using an 'if' case would be more readable IMO.

You should use debugstr_a() here (and in a few other places).

These look like they would be problematic on 64-bit, does it really
work like that?

"srcfile" is an external string, this should use debugstr_a().

Welcome to Wine development!  Poker playing penguins salute you.

As Dmitry wrote, adding a test case would be a good idea;

You should call this function only if your original CoInitializeEx
call succeeded. It may fail in a multithreaded apartment (in which
case WIC won't work either, but that's a bug), and in that case the
uninitialize is not needed.

Also, you seem to be leaving things uninitialized if you get an
unrecognized container format or pixel format. That's probably not a
good policy.

Subject: Hello, All!  Interested in GSoC
Message-ID: <BLU145-W4CDEC57594A104BEBCD2499190@phx.gbl>


Hello everyone,

I am Bradley Tucker, a junior computer science major at Tennessee Tech University, and I am very interested in participating in the Google Summer of Code.  I have a strong passion for developing video games, and it sounds like working with the Wine Project this summer would be incredibly helpful, informative, and fun.

I'm not sure exactly what I'm supposed to do to get started, so I'll just tell you a little about me and what I'd like to do.

First of all, I am primarily a Windows user who is trying learn more about Linux and all the wonderful things it can do.  I have experience programming in C++ and Java, but I am a quick learner and would gladly become fluent in another language, if necessary.  I do not have any experience working in an open-source community, but again, I am always ready to learn and to try new things.  I would like to participate in the Google Summer of Code because I feel it will help me gain necessary skills and knowledge that will help me once I graduate, while benefiting all others who use open-source software.  While I may not be the most qualified individual right now, I promise that if I am selected to work for the Wine Project this summer, I will quickly do whatever I can to become as qualified as possible.  I am a sociable and easy-to-get-along-with sort of guy, but I am extremely determined and hard-working, and I will do whatever I can to help the project progress.

As I said before, I am very interested in gaming, so naturally Wine is project that I believe I will thoroughly enjoy working on.  Firstly, I would be very interested in improving or testing any Direct3D features.  Testing and finding bugs for recent releases would be tremendously beneficial in helping me get ready for a career in the gaming industry.  So, finding bugs and ways to optimize recent releases would probably be my top choice for working on a project with Wine.  I also enjoy playing classic games as much as the latest releases.  The 
suggested idea of "implementing DOS graphics modes more faithfully" is 
one I would find tremendously interesting and hopefully informative.  I 
don't know enough about Wine yet to give many specifics, but I would 
gladly work on any bugs or features that my mentor would find most 
crucial.  While these are the topics that stood out most to me, I would honestly be willing to help out in any area that could use my help.

As I said, I don't know if this is the best way to introduce myself or if this is the best way to present the ideas I would like to possibly work on.  But, here I am, willing and able to help in whatever ways you would like.

My e-mail address is bradley-tucker at hotmail.com, so feel free to contact me whenever you please, with any questions or comments.  I am a student with classes, so I may not be able to respond right away.

Thanks, and I hope to working with you this summer!

In 32 bit, handles use this scheme (or something similar). I guess the 
same is used for 64-bit.
I will update the patch to work on both platforms.

You should continue in this case, but don't call CoUninitialize at the end.

How is that different? You'd have to cast to UINT_PTR to fit a 64-bit
pointer in there, although of course that only works if D3DXHANDLE is
also a 64-bit value on 64-bit Windows (didn't check).

It's a problem with the existing code, but checking the usage here doesn't make much sense. It should check if the surface is a front buffer on any swapchain(or, as long as we store a P8 surface as ARGB in GL this code also applies to backbuffers)

D3DXHANDLE maps to LPCSTR type so go for UINT_PTR.

There are some other places which do the same (both P8 and other
code). It might be nice to rewrite it e.g. using the
p8_primary_render_target call or so perhaps something more generic. In
case of DDraw (without P8 textures) we seem to set
WINED3DUSAGE_RENDERTARGET only for the primary surface on the ddraw
side though.

Would you mind if I rewrote this part at a later stage? It isn't that
critical right now. I mainly rewrote it to get
is_color_fixup_supported out of the way and it also fixed bugs. If you
want I could add a 'TODO' comment, so that it won't be forgotten.

Hi all,

I've seen a few very good proposals on the mailing list, but not enough

you haven't done so already please apply there now. You can still modify

Message-ID: <s2ya71bd89a1004052157qd46f8dccu52217898d23ade67@mail.gmail.com>

My little automated app installer tool, wisotool, now supports seven apps:
assassinscreed, diablo2, dragonage, morrowind, sims3, starcraft, and
wog (world of goo)
It also seems to run on Windows ok in Cygwin (though I've only barely
tested that).

Thanks to Austin for dragonage, morrowind, and some windows fixes,
and Eleazar Galano for a draft of the assassinscreed verb.

I've updated the doc at
  http://wiki.winehq.org/wisotool

It has a section explaining the difference between wisotool and somewhat
related things like appinstall and PlayOnLinux.  (In a nutshell, wisotool
is a winetricks-like tool for installing games automatically, with no user
interaction.  It caches .iso files to automate disc-swapping for
multiple-disc apps,
and caches cd keys to automate installers that need keys, but you
have to load the cache from your real copy of the cds or dvds first.)

There exists some branch of DOSBox called MegaBuild. [3]

It implements LPT port emulation and enhances serial port emulation (at 
least for DirectSerial mode -- now MegaBuild5 switches DSR-DTR/DCD signal 
pair (and CTS-RTS one also) correctly with appropriate hardware loopback 
used.

LPT hardware loopback works also with DOS application.

Official DOSBox doesn't do that, so I believe you could use MegaBuild for 
games also.

I tested ... = (WORD)MCI_ALL_DEVICE_ID which
should do the same.  It does not yield the "all" functionality.

Yes, and it is in the tests.  Alas, you'll have to believe my comment therein
that Win9x returns a 16bit FFFF and the others a 32bit FFFFFFFF,
because the testsuite never works like
ok((iswin9x && MCI_ALL_DEVICE_ID==err) || !iswin9x && (WORD)MCI_ALL_DEVICE_ID==err))

While we know that
1. mciDeviceID "all" yields 0000FFFF in Win9x and that
2. mciCommand(0000FFFF, MCI_SYSINFO ...) yield "all" only in Win9x
sadly we don't know if some Win9x app out there uses 0000FFFF as MCIDEVICEID.

My opinion is that MCIDEVICEID has to be treated in Wine like a 16bit entity
because compatibility with Win9x requires it and the question whether >65535
handles can be opened is not interesting in practice -- or we'll have to start
writing version-dependent code.

This is wrong, even when selecting for no events you want to receive
POLLHUP/POLLERR. If you really don't want any events you have to use -1
to remove the fd from the loop. But in general ignoring POLLHUP/POLLERR
is a bug.

I meant sending and querying status line operations at UART I/O port level

I have an idea how to get native windows mozilla plugins to work in
native Linux mozilla...

as you know in Chrome each new tab is its own independent process yet
they all share a parent x-window so... if you could create a Windows
which would host an active-x plugin or just the mozilla NP_PAPI plugin
it could serve as an wrapper okay so create a generic "plugin wrapper"
for mozilla and start a new instance of wine the application that hosts
the active-x plugin and set its parent as the mozillas window... this
hosting an Active-X plugin via NP_PAPI does work in Windows btw...

The purpose of offbits is not clear. Besides "?:" is absolutely not readable,
putting an explicit 0 there would help a bit. Adding a test case wouldn't hurt
either.

It has the same purpose as 'offbits' in
BmpFrameDecode_ReadUncompressed() from bmpdecode.c. And in bfOffBits,
too. Please give me a hint, I still think it is clear this way.

:D Okay, that proves your point. This is a short from for 'offbits ?
offbits : size'. Will fix that.

Hmm, do you have a pointer for a test verifying how something should
look like (in contrast to checking a return value)? Was this not
necessary for LoadImage() in general?

Message-ID: <47CC5ABB01651443A88DB8EC5B4D657B740311@S4DE8PSAANK.mitte.t-com.de>

Hi,

does anybody know why msvideo_decode_8bit(), when imported
from the FFmpeg project in 2004, was changed such that the
pixels[] array became filled upside down?  See how
#ifdef ORIGINAL,
  which shows the original FFmpeg code, differs from the
#else
  branch in msvideo1.c

Do buffers in Wine work upside down and backwards?
Why can't Wine use exactly FFmpeg's code?

I'm asking because no similar set of changes was applied to
msvideo_decode_16bit().  I have files that are rendered
incorrectly and even suspect of crashing Wine because of
this.  I could write a patch but need to know.

Thank you for your help,
 J?rg H?hle

See BITMAPINFOHEADER documentation for biHeight:

http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd183376%28VS.85%29.aspx

However not all codecs handle negative height properly, and just ignore 
the information the sign gives. This is probably why ffmpeg puts it 
upside down internally.

Maarten

Would allowing adding the fd to the poll loop after it has been
removed be more sane? Otherwise we have to resort to ugly things like
sock_try_event (which only half work).

I don't think that makes sense either. The error condition is not going
to go away so you can no longer poll on it anyway, you really need to
close the socket and create a new one.

Message-ID: <z2t58aa73be1004061921t71d73d5co7b1055043aa12bae@mail.gmail.com>

Hello devels,
     I'm looking at submitting a SoC proposal to the wine project, but I'm
feeling a little overwhelmed as my current coding experience is all over the
place, and very little of it working with existing projects. My most recent
work has been looking  low-level code and algorithms behind basic OpenGL, so
I thought perhaps I might be able to make relevant contributions to the
project of testing and improving Direct3D support. Can anyone that knows
more about whats under the hood for that sort of functionality in wine tell
me what kind of magnitude of project I might be looking at? Only a limited
number of bug reports have been filed, but all seem to be indicative of
fairly major issues. Once I get more of an idea of what I might be dealing
with (and examine some of the problems myself) I can fine-tune my proposal.
Thanks,
    Conrad

It's maybe the wrong place but I'm quite sure interested people read
wine-devel.

I think it would be great if we could
not only run tests (as it already does)
but also check if a patch does not break wine (on minGW, on cygwin or on MAC
for instance).

Thus, we could choose a kind of WINEBUILD VM to tell wineTestBot to only
compile wine with our patch.

Currently, I can't compile on Linux and cygwin is very slow.
So it would make my life easier if I could rely on wineTestBot...


Comments are welcome
Thanks

For any productive Wine development you need not only working compiling
environment, but a working Wine binary, to run at least 'make test'.

You can't use ifdefs, this needs to depend on the CPU type of the client
process.

Message-ID: <4BBC79E1.8080004@thehandofagony.com>

Hello,

I'm a student interested in participating in Google's Summer of Code. 
This isn't my first mail to the wine-devel list; I was a GSoC 
partiicpant in 2007, where I worked on WIne's WordPad clone. I have also 
done some work on the AppDB as well as minor bug fixes and lately a 
(little) work on some dsound tests. Other, non-Wine related code I've 
written include work with low-level keyboard hoo

There are a few projects I have in mind. I've had a look at the Wiki, 
and both 'Implementing the Internet Explorer GUI' and working on the 
Control Panel applets seem like interesting projects. Have any students 
applied for these yet? My only COM experience so far has been 
implementing a few stubs for DirectPlay, as well as some dsound tests:

http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-patches/2010-February/084881.html


As for my own project ideas, I think it would have been interesting to 
implement IPX over TCP in winsock, since most of the games that use IPX 
require root access for it to work. This feature could perhaps be 
enabled in winecfg or the Control Panel. I don't have any experience 
with networkking, though, so I'm concerned that this might be a bit 
amibitous.


I would appreciate feedback of any kind, and yes, I know that time is 
running out with respect to the application deadline :)

Alexander N. S?rnes

Hi Alexander,

Good to see you back in GSoc. I can't comment on IE / control panel as
I don't know much about it but I will comment to another small part.

It should be possible to implement IPX over TCP but when you do this,
the other side also needs to wrap IPX in a TCP packet.  (there are
various user space tools I believe which can do this). IPX can be used
without root permissions if you use posix file capabilities to enable
raw sockets on wineserver. I experimented with this a long time ago
and I wasn't able to get it working at that time but this should
somehow work.

Subject: winmm: Improve MCI A/W mapping slightly.

Hi,

I forgot to mention that this patch was rebased against 1.1.42,
supersedes the former "Fix A/W mapping for 64bit Wine" patch and
is not dependent on prior 64bit patches.

Currently, I can't think of a fully general solution to the A/W
mapping problem. In theory, an unknown driver with new unknown
commands and keywords could be registered.  We have little idea how
large the structure is and which flags controls the validity of the
nth slot, e.g. when to call strdupAtoW().

One could think about parsing the command table to obtain this
information.  However,
 a) I see no guarantee that there's a unique MCI_STRING value for a
    given bit that is set in the flags parameter.
 b) This does not help with baroque commands like SYSINFO which
    sometimes put a string, sometimes a DWORD into the result buffer
    or which are documented to count buffer sizes in bytes, unlike
    other commands.

This latter example reveals that calling MCI_Cleanup() before
unwrapping is unfortunate, as valuable type information is
lost.  It is currently encapsulated inside mciSendCommandW.

Open questions:
 - Does Wine actually support hooking in a new native MCI driver?
   (beside DLL overrides)

 - Why does Wine copy dwCallback only when MCI_NOTIFY is set? It is
   not wrong, but why care? To prevent a Valgrind message when that
   slot was not filled by the caller?

BTW, my (unpublished) testing reveals that unlike what MSDN says,
dwRetSize is counted in characters in MCI_SYSINFO_PARMSW, not bytes
(at least on w2k with SYSINFO_NAME [OPEN]). But that shall be the
subject of another patch.

Regards,
 J?rg H?hle

Ok so I could not run any test until compiling on cygwin works.
But the idea was to be able to remotly compile wine with some of our patches
applied.

I was told "you can't do that, it will break minGW".
The WINEBUILD VM exists but we can't use it (or tell me how to do that)

Of course I could install MinGW on my PC too...

Even if compiling under Cygwin works, the tests still require running
them under Wine, and Wine can't run under Cygwin (and most likely will
never be able to).

Patchwatcher is suppose to sort of do this. It only works for linux, not
other systems, but it will not only check your patch against compiling but
also against the test suit and mark and regressions.

The WINEBUILD VM is only used to cross-compile tests in case you submit a patch and not a test executable to the bot. Running tests on Wine is outside the scope of WineTestBot (perhaps it should be called WinTestBot...), it is aimed at making sure that the tests themselves are correct (by checking that they don't fail on Windows).

Subject: Mac OS X technologies
Message-ID: <BLU0-SMTP571569584E9549BA93F8B2B9170@phx.gbl>

There is a long list of technologies in Mac OS X that could be used to improve Wine on OS X. One of them is ColorSync. ColorSync is a color management software that is HEAVILY integrated into the Mac OS. For instance, you can calibrate your monitor and when OS X starts up, it will read the color profile file and adjust the graphics card output.  It will also do color correction automatically in, e.g. Preview to get the best out of an image.

However, I do not know how ColorSync influences Mac OS X's X11 system.  It is possible that in order to take full advantage of ColorSync, a Mac OS X native front-end will need to be developed.

Another interesting Mac OS X technology is Image Capture.  This technology is used by the OS to scan images from a scanner as well as import images from a camera (iPhoto).  It provides a wrapper around TWAIN drivers so they can be used by applications that don't support TWAIN.  This is a purely C Framework. Although a sub-framework of the Carbon Framework, the functions are available in 64-bit code.  This should not be confused with the ImageCaptureKit framework, which is most likely an Objective-c wrapper around the main Image Capture framework.

It's perfectly fine to require a parameter to be non-NULL, and just
crash if it isn't. You'll get a nice backtrace, or at least an
exception, which helps debugging as well.

Similar as above. In general if Windows doesn't check something, we
don't either. However, it's worth noting that if we'd be writing to
that index we sometimes do check those, because there's the potential
for memory corruption in those cases.

That's only true in the case of a full close; if you do
shutdown(,SD_SEND) on the remote end, we will get POLLIN/0 recv, but
if we decide to do a send after that and the connection gets broken
(either the remote fully closes the socket or we get connection
reset), we will receive a POLLHUP/POLLERR with a different error code,
which is what windows reports. The problem is that there are two
halves of the connection to hang up (when both have hangup we get a
POLLHUP, otherwise just a POLLIN/0 recv). (data from
http://www.greenend.org.uk/rjk/2001/06/poll.html )

But I see your point that perhaps it doesn't belong in the main loop
when one of the halves gets closed. I guess we can keep sock_try_event
around but only use it when the socket has been removed from the main
loop. I'll also add detection of half-closed connection and drop that
event if the other half hasn't hung up yet. Sadly looks like MacOS
will be left out of that detection since it reports POLLIN|POLLHUP for
everything.

Does that sound good?

Mike.

Hi Jacek,

Sorry for my delayed response. Thank you for your suggestions.

For the testing infrastructure, I was thinking about writing a few Windows
programs that use Microsoft's IUri implementation to generate the results
that my testing infrastructure would use to make sure my implementation is
working correctly. Is this the right approach or would you recommend doing
it another way?

Also, I have finished a rough draft of my proposal and I was wondering if it

I've found the winetricks script invaluable in trying to get my app
running on Wine.  But I found that when installing msxml6, I needed to
change the overrides for msi.dll and msiexec.exe to "builtin,native".  I
previously installed the native msi20, and msxml6 wouldn't install with
the native installer.  It installs fine with the builtin installer.

 

Thanks,

Hi, Troy.

Could you also open a bug for this msxml6 installer problem?

Actually, from Troy's description, there isn't any valid bug at all.
Troy claims that the msxml6 installer broke when using native msi.dll
but succeeded with Wine's msi implementation. Native msi tends to be
pretty useless and break when used on Wine, and there's no problem in
Wine, so a bug would be useless here.

Hi,

First of all welcome to Wine. Our Direct3D -> OpenGL code is quite
complex and has a steep learning curve, so just hacking on Direct3D to
improve big chunks of code isn't that suited. That said there is
certainly work which you could do in the testing / bug hunting area.

For instance you could work on improving our test suite. Currently
mostly Nvidia systems pass the tests. For a part this is due to driver
bugs in the other drivers but some tests are also too strict and there
might be some WineD3D bugs. You could fix broken tests, fix bugs in
our Direct3D code found by the tests, you could add new tests and
perhaps you could also improve the tests on Windows. If you want you
might be able to fix some normal Direct3D bug reports as well (those
will likely require new tests). It might be hard to write a good
proposal though (especially judging whether you reached your goals
might be hard).

Another form of testing which you could improve is our 'gaming' test
suite in which performance in games is tested for regressions. I have
never used those tests but according to Stefan the test suite can use
improvements. Perhaps some visual tests could be added to them as
well, to see if there are no visual regressions. Not sure how that
should work but I guess you would need a mechanism for recording
keyboard/mouse movements and playing them back, so that you reach
fixed spots at which you can make screenshots for comparisons.

The two suggestions and some more info can also be found in a recent
thread which can be found here:
http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2010-March/082698.html
http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2010-March/082707.html

Good luck writing a proposal and if you have questions just ask!
Roderick

Test should be integrated with Wine tests. See dlls/shlwapi/tests/url.c 
and dlls/wininet/tests/url.c for an idea of how it should be done.

If you have specific questions, feel free to ask here. Proposal itself 
should be posted to gsoc app. It's capable of editing proposals and 
getting feedback.

I don't think so.

Looking at cpu_blit, that "blitter" has exactly a single function
that's actually used, and it might as well have been a function on its
own. I've twice pointed out how to avoid that situation, but for some
reason you ignored that. In the case of cpu_blit I went along with
that in the assumption that later patches would fix it, but I'm not
having another implementation like that.

I'm not so convinced by the idea of having mutable format
descriptions. What problem are you solving, and why is this the best
solution? At the very least the patch looks like it could be split
though.

The ultimate goals are to reduce the use of d3dfmt_get_conv (some
places can just use the format table) and to clean up d3dfmt_get_conv.
I don't like a mutable format descriptor either but it is temporarily.
The texture format fixups can all be moved over to the formats table
(see patch 3). In a next step the color keying part could be cleaned
up. The switch statement there could for instance be turned into a
small wined3d_format_desc table.

I think sock_try_event shouldn't even do a poll() at all. Once we have
received POLLHUP there's no point in continuing to poll. All it should
have to do is try a MSG_PEEK read to detect EOF for platforms where that
triggers a POLLHUP. All other cases should be handled by the main loop.

Argh, it seems I made a stupid copy&paste error. I wrote the code a
few weeks ago and did test that well on my desktop but on my laptop
(ATi..) the d3d9 V8U8 test and a lot of others never worked :( The
original patch code worked fine, I assumed it would still work (bad,
bad, bad but I only have the laptop) ...

+    unsigned int            byte_count_fixup, Flags;
     GL_SupportedExt extension;
+    void (*convert)(const BYTE *src, BYTE *dst, UINT pitch, UINT width,
+                    UINT height, UINT outpitch);
 } GlPixelFormatDescTemplate;

When I resubmit it, I will test it with another format which has tests
which work on my laptop first.

Correct.  This isn't a bug in Wine.  It's a suggestion for making WineTricks more robust.  The reason I sent this email re WineTricks is because at:
http://wiki.winehq.org/winetricks
 
It says:

Reporting bugs *in* Winetricks

Winetricks has a bug tracking system at http://code.google.com/p/winezeug/issues/list though sending email to wine-devel at winehq.org is usually good enough.

Actually, from Troy's description, there isn't any valid bug at all.
Troy claims that the msxml6 installer broke when using native msi.dll
but succeeded with Wine's msi implementation. Native msi tends to be
pretty useless and break when used on Wine, and there's no problem in
Wine, so a bug would be useless here.

Indeed, and I believe MS puts APC to even more uses than documented, c.f.
http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3930#c37
Maybe there are other places where Wine ought to use APC.

One issue with APC for WINMM is that one needs further tests to
investigate which call causes memoization of the GetCurrentThread()
field to which the callback will be delivered?
 - Is is the thread that called midiOpen?
 - The thread that called midiWrite?

BTW, would it be ok for Wine to
 a) include a patch that introduces version-specific behaviour
   (as mentioned in the above bug)?
 b) Or should Wine's WINMM generally behave like Win9X because
    it's old and many newer apps use another API?
 c) Like W2k/xp/7 because that's what's current now.

You should at the very least add a comment to that empty block.

This won't work for implementing half-closed sockets. If we have only
the read half is closed, we will get POLLIN/0 recv indefinitely if we
keep polling (not POLLHUP). If we remove it from the loop, we have to
keep polling (once in a while, i.e. when an enable_socket_event gets
through) until we get a POLLHUP/POLLERR which signals the other half
is closed. On some platforms this won't work, but they will jump to a
full close automatically (i.e. POLLHUP right away). The problem now is
that if we receive a shutdown, we will spam FD_CLOSE on every
successful send.

I suppose if we don't care to send more than 1 FD_CLOSE (which windows
does do), we can just remove the socket from the loop and be done with
it. I don't know if any apps actually depend on receiving a second
FD_CLOSE after the remote end has sent a shutdown.

Should we just implement the 1 FD_CLOSE behavior and then if any
regressions relating to it pop up bring back try_event?

Mike.

I don't see why. If you don't get POLLHUP then you can keep polling,
just don't select for POLLIN once you have seen EOF. The problem with
POLLHUP/POLLERR is that they can't be masked, but POLLIN doesn't have
that issue.

By that logic, winetricks would need to set most dll's to native when
installing _anything_, on the off chance that the user has overridden
the builtin dll.

Respected,
I would like to contribute to the Wine development under the Google Summer
Code.
Have a knowledge of C Language and Vast Experience on Operating Systems

 I have worked and managed various OS ( OPERATING SYSTEMS ) of various
PLATFORMS like:-
 * *
* *

*LINUX Platform*

Ubuntu 6.10

Ubuntu 7.04

Ubuntu 7.10

Ubuntu 8.04

Ubuntu 8.10

Ubutnu 9.04

Ubuntu Server 9.04

Fedora 9

Suse


*Microsoft Windows Platform*

Microsoft Windows 3x

Microsoft Windows 95

Microsoft Windows 98

Microsoft Windows ME

Microsoft Windows Server 2000

Microsoft Windows XP

Microsoft Windows Server 2003

Microsoft Windows Vista

Microsoft Windows 7


*
*

*Macintosh Platform*

Tiger MAC OSX 10.4 **

Leopard MAC OSX 10.5


Opensource is what i promote and as is visible from my mention above, I am a
Linux ( opensource supported ).

>My idea/purposal would be to make wine, powerful-enough interms of its
felxibilty to automatically find the .dll and other lib files req. for the
functioning of .exe files in the Linux OS. Inturn making the Opensource
world more friendly to the Other side. Like the MACFUSE on Mac OS X utilises
a folder approach i.e. it creates a folder with a file index so that the
efficiency of MAC is maintained while making NTFS 3G compatible with HFS+,
similarly as Wine can identify the Windows Drive, it should also be able to
think like a windows OS not as a Program on Linux running .exe files. To
this there are two approaches:-

   1. Decrypting the .exe file to its skin and recompiling it to run in the
   Linux way
   2. Making the .exe files a better illusion of windows while providing a
   better experience of the Linux world to the User


I'm keen to learn as much as I can from this opportunity provided and
contribute to the Development to the best of my caliber.

Reporting issues here is fine, Dan and I will see them here, and it
saves you trouble from registering on google code. Emailing me/Dan
directly is also fine.

Since it's known that the native msi installer doesn't work, it seems reasonable to me that you'd set the override to use the builtin msi.  This is similar to how it overrides the winver to win98 when installing mdac.  It's a known "trick" to get it to install.  How is this second guessing the user?

By that logic, winetricks would need to set most dll's to native when
installing _anything_, on the off chance that the user has overridden
the builtin dll.

It's very unclear what you're proposing.

Running Wine from an NTFS partition would provide little benefit, and
Wine cannot interact sensibly with a real Windows install.

Wine includes a loader capable of loading/linking PE .exe and .dll
files in memory. Attempting to take apart a PE file and put it
together in a different format wouldn't provide any compatibility
benefits.

What is the problem you want to solve?

Even if "likely" literally means "vraisemblable" I think the previous

If I start a program under debugger control with "./wine winedbg 
~/test/my.exe" then I see errors such as "Can't get context for thread 
0021 in current process" or backtraces like this:

Backtrace:
=>0 0xf773d42e uni2cp_low+0x576e() in libwine.so.1 (0x0033f7a8)

Backtrace:
=>0 0xf773d42e uni2cp_low+0x576e() in libwine.so.1 (0x0033f7a8)
0xf771d42e: jmp 0xf771d423


If a program crashes and invokes the debugger (which I have modified to 
execute "bt all" instead of "bt" by default), I get a full set of 
backtraces.

I have also been seeing "err:dbghelp_msc:pe_load_debug_directory Got a 
page fault while loading symbols" on executables and matching PDB files 
generated by the Intel Compiler. It seems that MSVC generated 
executables and PDBs work fine. That problem has been around for quite a 
while, certainly before 1.1.40

This is broken, you can't make assumptions about the high bit of pointer
values. The handle management needs more thought.

Obviously you cannot hardcode specific locales like that.

A cursory glance does not reveal any mention of libalsa as a valid
"sound input", and I'm not sure but I think it falsely implies that
jack can't use OSS backend.

This is somewhat confusing:

*  PulseAudio is an audio mixer that provides a finer grained control
over volume (being able to set it per-application), etc.

*  GStreamer is not solving the same problem as PulseAudio (PulseAudio
is not a multimedia framework). GStreamer adds support for playing,
synchronising and encoding audio and video media so is fulfilling a
different role in the audio landscape -- you cannot decode ogg files
directly through PulseAudio, for example.

*  The Xine framework is like GStreamer and FFmpeg/MPlayer. AFAICS,
this is independant of GStreamer and thus sits on top of PulseAudio,
ALSA, Jack, etc. I can't see anything that says that xine-lib calls
into GStreamer.

*  Phonon is an API that abstracts the multimedia frameworks and sits
on top of either GStreamer or Xine (or other supported backends), with
Xine being the default.

The diagrams there are generally much more representative of the
reality of audio APIs in Linux systems. A few gems:
"As should be obvious, these sound servers today do nothing except add
latency, and should be done away with."
"Compare the insanity that is PulseAudio ..."

Whether we like it our not audio servers are the future, they make
things a lot easier for users they don't care about the card but only
see a microphone, speakers and other input/output devices and don't
know how it is wired up. The audio server (or whatever thing you use
as a 'router') all takes care of it.

Windows Vista/Win7 also use a sound server quite similar to
pulseaudio. In Wine, Maarten is busy implementing these new Windows
APIs and older winmm (and perhaps dsound) will be layered on top of it
which is also what Windows does. The design will use OpenAL and
whether that's a good choice is another discussion.

Well I thought about putting it in non-infinitive form, but it didn't
sound/feel right to me.

In fact "N'affiche" would be more like a description, while
"N'afficher" is more an action/modifier/behaviour "alterator"
which seems the purpose of an command-line option IMHO.

My understanding was that it looked first in the system path, then
tried in, e.g., the home dir or other
directories.
I guess it looks in a hardcoded list of dirs, or sthg like that. In
that sense, "possibles" does not fit IMO.
"potentiels" or "vraisemblables" could both fit, but I wanted to
insist on the probability for the command
to be there (sthg like P[potentiels] < P[vraisemblables]).

Hi Andr?,

lstrcmpW is not implemented on Win95/98/Me so these tests will always 
succeed.

You should probably add a lstrcmpW call at the beginning and skip when 
not implemented, something like:

SetLastError(0xdeadbeef);
lstrcmpW(markerW, nomarkerW);
if (GetLastError() == ERROR_CALL_NOT_IMPLEMENTED)
{
     win_skip("lstrcmpW is not implemented\n");
     return;
}

These weren't in the original function. Perhaps they should but, but

This entire check would be redundant after the is_identity_fixup() checks above.

What this test is supposed to show? Is there a bug that prevents real world
application not to function properly under Wine? Besides, lstrcmpW() is just
a wrapper for CompareStringW(), and there is a bunch of tests for it already.
Testing explicit unicode values is not useful, Wine uses different unicode
tables than Windows does.

Subject: winetricks failed, expecting "system32" where I have "System32" and

Message-ID: <4BBF2F94.50700@hist.no>

I just tried installing gdiplus using winetricks, on a debian testing 
system.

This failed, as winetricks tried to copy stuff into windows/system32,
where I happen to have Windows/System32.

I first tried making symlinks windows->Windows and system32->System32.
winetricks would run, but the app using gdiplus.dll now failed to find 
it. The file was in Windows/System32 as expected.

So I removed my links, and used search&replace on winetricks, to replace 
all occurences of "windows" and "system32" with captialized versions. 
Then I ran winetricks again. The installation succeeded this time too, 
but the app could still not find the dll in System32.

I finally gave up and copied the dll into the directory where the app
is installed. This worked, but is problematic; it will have to be done 
for every app that uses this dll.

Why did you rename system32? Are you linking your ~/.wine/drive_c to a
real windows installation?

As usual start with a clean Wine prefix 'rm -rf ~/.wine', and try again.

Hang on right there.  Why?   Once I understand that, the rest will be easier.

Winetricks does handle the case where users renamed windows/fonts to
windows/Fonts, because it was observed happening in the wild
(one can imagine users doing thiis when manually installing fonts).
But this is the first I've heard of a System32 rather than a system32.

Just something else which is a little related. Does winetricks handle
SysWow64 already?

Shoot, I'm sorry I was confusing poll vs FD_*. You're right of course,
that would work. The slight problem is that a 0 recv is not
necessarily a full POLLHUP (i.e. both halves closed). So on platforms
that don't signal POLLHUP/POLLERR when both halves are closed we're
going to sit there and do nothing, after the first half of the socket
is closed. (Are there any like this still around?) In other words we
can get rid of try_event completely.

There is also a small issue that even after a full close, windows will
let you call send() and succeed but with an erroneous FD_CLOSE right
after. I think the best way to deal with it is just to special case it
in enable_socket_event to send an error close without polling
anything, if for some reason FD_CLOSE is unheld.

I'll send patches on Monday.

Mike.

What about 'Masque (tous) les messages de statut', that should do the trick.

It tries PATH and BINDIR (and server/wineserver if in a build
directory). See
http://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/?a=blob;f=libs/wine/config.c#l480
So 'potentiels' or 'possibles' fit better IMHO.

I've removed the keywords bugbuster, noappdbentry, tasklet, and
tasklist from all bugs. Could someone with the appropriate bugzilla
permissions please delete the keywords themselves?

Subject: WineTestBot: phase 3 implemented
Message-ID: <1C77FC3365DBD149802E0F5381EBE2C9024ACC73B1@EXCH-MBX-4.vmware.com>

I'm happy to announce that WineTestBot (http://winetestbot.geldorp.nl) is now actively scanning wine-patches submissions for changes to tests. If it finds a test change, it will apply the changes, build the affected test executables and run them on the base VMs. Results will be mailed back to the submitter. It will also try to determine if new failures were introduced, by comparing the test results to the most recent run using winetest.exe from WineHQ. If it thinks there are new failures, a message is sent to the author with a copy to wine-devel.

The bot will only process complete series, so it will queue up patches that appear to be part of a series. Then when the series is complete, it generates one big patch file by adding all the individual patches from the series together before submitting it. We'll have to see how robust this is, it is quite possible to mess up this algorithm.

Only patches that contain changes to tests are run. It checks to see if any dlls/<dllname>/tests/* files were changed, if so it is deemed a change to the tests. This should cover most cases, but again is not 100% correct all the time (if you only change a file in include/ then the tests depending on the header files don't get run). In the end we still have the daily run that's done when Alexandre publishes a new winetest.exe.

There's a new item in the WineTestBot menu, "Wine-patches". It will show which patches have been received via the mailing list and what the bot has done with them.

Of course, you'll still be able to manually submit a patch to the bot too. These run at higher priority than the jobs generated from wine-patches submissions.

Happy testing, Ge.

Subject: compiling just user32.dll
Message-ID: <4BC248E1.5080502@utoronto.ca>

I got wine sources and I'm on a debian system. So I want to edit the 
function GetMenuBarInfo in user32.dll to just fill in the menu structure 
with some fake/resonable/constant values. I want to do this cause I 
think visual boy advance looks at those values and resets the screen 
size. And unfortunatly everytime it does it I have to press ALT+click to 
move it up to see the resize on bottom right and resize. I'm thinking 
just put some fake values especialy for the rect sturcture and have wine 
use it.

I don't want to recompile the whole thing I'm just hoping I can compile 
just the user32.dll put it into windows/system32 and tell wine (which is 
installed from package manager) via winecfg to simply use that dll.

Is it possible and easy for me? I already found GetMenuBarInfo and it 
just calls FIXME; I need to change it to modify the structure and 
compile user32.dll.

Thank you

After configuring, you cd to dlls/user32 and do a make in that
directory, like this:

./configure
make -C dlls/user32

The 'C' parameter tells make to change to that directory before making.

But seriously, why are you trying to run the Win32 version VisualBoy
Advance in Wine anyway? You do realize that it runs natively on Linux,
right?

I've hacked at this enough to get some basic USB I/O working, so now I
have a better idea of what's necessary.

I like usbhub.sys separate from usbd.sys because:
* The service is called Usbhub in the registry, drivers might depend
on the service, and having the service load usbd.sys instead of
usbhub.sys is confusing.
* usbd.sys isn't part of the device stack in any way, it's just a
utility library used to do miscellaneous things like parse USB
descriptors. Putting I/O code in there would be confusing.
* Windows from 2000 onwards uses usbhub.sys for device stack
management and I/O. No Windows version uses usbd.sys like that.
* If we don't want dlls that export nothing, mountmgr.sys also exports
nothing, so it should be part of ntoskrnl.exe by the same logic.
* There will no more usbXXX.sys files for basic USB after usbhub.sys.
We might eventually want higher-level device class drivers
(usbstor.sys, usbprint.sys) and Microsoft-provided generic drivers
(usbscan.sys) though.
* The driver doesn't load first and load usbd.sys via an import which
creates a device stack, usbhub.sys loads first and then loads drivers
(into the same process) on-demand, as their USB devices are plugged
in.

A *very hacked* patch is attached, if you want to see how libusb-1.0
is used. It only works just enough for the driver to read descriptors
from the device and send a few basic I/O requests.

I'd like to start sending real patches soon, so can I add a separate
usbhub.sys or do I have to stick with usbd.sys? And is libusb-1.0 ok?

Thank you

Hi Greg,

Perhaps you could also check for programs/<programname>/tests/ now
that at least cmd has tests.
WineTestBot is a wonderful tool, thanks for supporting and improving it!

Our product both have windows version and QT version, the windows version has more functions.
 we MUST move all of function to Linux OS.
 The windows version has already move to linux currently, some of code has been rewritten. Here comes the questions, as we know ,both wine and qt choose X11 as its windows implemention,  is there any way to implement QWindow or QWidget using MFC ?
  
 thanks in advance.

You're probably not going to have much luck with that.

Better (and easier, I bet) to do a pure port.

Even easier to run the Windows version in Wine.
Have you tried that yet?
There are ways (see Google's Picasa) to hide
drive letters from the user somewhat.

There's a pretty lengthy patch in there too. Worth having a look at.

Message-ID: <z2lb6bb06271004112147na4620fabg320f2b9c29c6957@mail.gmail.com>

Howdy all,

I've updated winetricks's directx-beta verb to hopefully workaround
the problems it has in wine. Using directx-beta now installs directx
in winxp mode, then also extracts and regsvr's the directplay and
directmusic dll's (using the winetricks directplay and the new
winetricks directmusic options).

Please test on your applications that need native directx dlls. I
don't have an application that needs directmusic, so if it doesn't
work, please let me know. If something is missing from directx-beta
that is installed in win2k mode, please let me know.

Get it at http://winezeug.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/winetricks

"Probables" may possibly fit even better (altough "potentiels" should be OK)?

I never renamed system32 - I don't like uppercase in filenames. I can 
only guess that wine did it that way itself in 2003 when I installed it.

I have no real windows installation. I use wine to run the one windows 
program I need - a raw converter for my digital camera.

Subject: [PATCH] d3dx9_36/tests: Move surface tests into surface.c
In-Reply-To: <201004120932.o3C9WNeW023087@v1.gse.nl>

Message-ID: <4BC2F3DB.3060503@wanadoo.fr>

The issues were existing before and thus not related to the patch.
The patch is only a file renaming and the test selector changed from 
"texture" to "surface" to match tested functions.
I will see if I can do something to fix the test failures.

Windows paths are case insensitive so anything in drive_c should be 
treated in a case-insensitive way. If winetricks does not do so, then it 
is buggy.

     The software said it requires Win95 or better, so I installed Linux.

It seems to me that the device detection needs to be handled by
mountmgr, you don't want a libusb polling loop. Also I don't think you
want to load all of usb inside the same process, native drivers will
crash, and that shouldn't take down the whole usb support. I'd say you
should have one process per device or something along those lines.

IMHO, "Probables" or "Vraisemblables" mean that it tries randomly some
paths and isn't at all certain to succeed, IOW it sounds really weak ;
where "Potentiels" or "Possibles" mean that if wineserver can't be
found in a fixed number of (logically computed) places, you need to
fix your system because you have a problem. I really prefer the second
option.

OK for "potentiels" in that case (although "probables" seems stronger
than "possibles" IMHO)

Going through struct blit_shader means that you should also check if
cpu_blit can do that operation.

That doesn't work of course, CTXUSAGE_CLEAR isn't there just for show.

Subject: [rfc] realtime priority patch based on rtkit
Message-ID: <4BC32AC6.3030508@gmail.com>

Hi all,

I decided to dig through the sample documentation for rtkit and see if I 
could find a way to make it work for wine.
There's still a few things missing: hardcoded libdbus soname, no 
checking if dbus is available, -I/usr/include/dbus-1.0 
-I/usr/lib/dbus-1.0/include should be added to ntdll/Makefile and 
SIGXCPU should demote all threads of the application back to normal priority

The server queues an APC to the target thread that signals it should try 
to acquire rt prio for it. the thread makes a request to rtkit over dbus 
to say it wants realtime. This is because rtkit requires the affected 
process to call dbus.

Any moral objections to this approach?

Do you have a test case which shows that notofication is not sent is the failure case?

Also 'if (MMSYSERR_NOERROR==dwRet' misses spaces, and having comparison reversed doesn't
match the style of the surrounding code.

I can remove it, but why? Is supporting break keys a WONTFIX in Wine?

It's already in mci.c:
    test_notification(hwnd, "sound notify", err ? 0 : MCI_NOTIFY_SUCCESSFUL);
It's how all commands I've tested to some depth so far behave.

Ok.  After being bitten at least once by assignment/comparison
mismatch I promised myself to use that style.  I'm myself used
to read code as "if A equals 3" rather than "if 3 is the value
of A" but I'm convinced that's just a matter of getting used
to this style that is less error-prone in C.

If that's really a problem then the first thing to do is start with some bug
reports or test cases. Adding spurious FIXME's is not an improvement.

I don't see any correspnding changes in that patch that remove todo_wine statements
in the tests. That suggests that either such tests don't exist, or that change actually
fixes nothing.

gcc prints a warning in most cases where you could make the mistake, so
it's not a good enough reason to make the code harder to read.

I think that Alexandre has commited your patch slightly in a hurry,
usually he waits at least several hours unless the patch is obviously
correct (which is not the case here IMO).

In my opinion your patch should be reverted until all the changes have
appropriate test cases, and that patch makes the tests pass (i.e. remove
existing todo_wine statements).

A third explanation is possible:
It's an example of one bug shadowing another bug.

There's no todo_wine to remove because
a) No Notification was sent in Wine because the parser did
   not correctly handle system commands.  MCI_Sound was never called so
   there was no notification.
b) There was no need for todo_wine in the past because this double error could
   not be detected.  No notification was and is the correct behaviour when the
   sound command returns an error, as it currently does.
b) When I fixed that in "try 1", AJ observed the notification test failure.
   That's why I had to fix the notification as well for "try 2".

The tests pass on MS (in both MMSYS_NOERROR and MCIERR_HARDWARE modes) proving they are ok.

 J?rg H?hle.

Then that's what you need to fix in the first place.

Since there is no neither todo_wine statements in the tests, nor test failures
under Wine that means that both the tests and the patch are not OK.

What has Wine to say when talking about the correctness
of tests?  Only native dictates what the test result should be.
The emerging rule is: "no notification in case of error", and there's even a
specific test case about the MCI sound string command in the tests.

I believe you forgot that AJ mentioned a notification test failure that
appeared with "try 1": So there was a test failure under Wine.

>> b) There was no need for todo_wine in the past because this double error could

>Then that's what you need to fix in the first place.

I cannot demonstrate the value of a fix to MCI_SOUND via a test case if the parser
never calls MCI_SOUND.  That's why the order in my git tree and that of submission is:
1. Get MCI_SOUND called (and fix the notification because of
   the test failure this introduces).
2. Get MCI_SOUND to actually play a sound (in my queue, past the 64bit patch).

I find it illogical to write a patch that would prefix an existing test
with todo_wine.  I aim at eliminating existing todo_wine.

Now I think the subject of my patch is misleading.  It should have read
"winmm: Correctly deal with MCI system commands." (to some extent).

 J?rg H?hle.

I'm not sure how the bot works but it looks like it concatenated some
of my patches together and then applied to them. I have no idea to
what Wine version it was since it applies fine on Wine git here. It
could be that I'm doing something wrong but I don't see where.

No, this is the bot messing up. For some reason I don't understand yet
it included one of your earlier patches ("[PATCH 08/13] d3d9: Add an
initial ColorFill regression test.") as the first of this series. That
threw everything off.

I'll disable emailing to wine-devel until I've sorted this out.

Ok, I understand what happened now... This is the sequence of patches you
submitted, in the order they arrived in my mail queue (oldest first):

1) [PATCH 4/7] wined3d: Move D15S1 over to the formats table.
2) [PATCH 1/7] wined3d: Move L6V5U5 conversion to the formats table.
3) [PATCH 5/7] wined3d: Move R32G32F convertion to the formats table.
4) [PATCH 3/7] wined3d: Move D24X4S4 to the formats table.
5) [PATCH 6/7] wined3d: Move G16R16/R16G16F conversion to the formats table.
6) 1/3 d3d9: Add an initial ColorFill regression test.
7) [PATCH 2/7] wined3d: Move D24FS8 to formats table.
8) [PATCH 7/7] wined3d: Move A4L4 conversion to the formats table.

Note the out-of-sequence arrival of number 6). The bot is not smart enough
to handle two series from the same author arriving interleaved. It will see
everything as one big series until all parts of a series have arrived. In
this case, the patch attached to message 6) overwrote the patch attached
to message 2) (both have part number 1).

Not sure how to handle this, except by asking people to leave some time
before sending another series.

Re-enabling emailing to wine-devel since this is working as designed.

Of course the tests are suppose to show the behaviour of Windows.

And another rule is that the patch which changes the behaviour of an API
needs to have an appropriate test case which does not pass before the patch
(i.e. has the todo_wine around it), and passes after the patch (i.e. the patch
removes the corresponding todo_wine). Your patch doesn't qualify for that.

Dan's Patchwatcher had more or less the same issue in the beginning, but 
wasn't that solved?

I think the only issue left was when people sent 2 series of equal 
patchcounts and they arrive mixed.

Hey Ge,

you could, instead of only checking for the author, also try to check 
for the maximum amount of patches. If you find patch [Patch 1/7], I 
assume you currently wait for all 7 patches. Now if a patch 1/3 comes in 
between, you'll see that the maximum is different, in this case 3, so 
you'll know that it's a different patch-set.

In case the maximum is also the same, it's also difficult for a human to 
see what patch belongs to what patch-set, so that should never happen in 
the first place. Unless AJ is a psychic of course.

Sven

P.S. Awesome work on the testbot.

I thought about that, but the drawback is that a new patch set is started
if the submitter mistypes the maximum (e.g. [1/4], [2/4], [3/5], [4/4]). In
that case we end up with two incomplete sets.
I've also considered taking the DLL name into account if available (most
people will include the DLL name in their Subject), but there are valid
patch sets spanning multiple DLLs (e.g. 1/3 d3d9: ..., 2/3 wined3d: ...,
3/3 wined3d: ...) so that won't work either.
I'll probably go back to using author + maximum as the key and perhaps
build a UI so an author can manually select patches belonging to a set
and put them in the right order. Then when a set still appears incomplete
after a couple of hours a reminder email could be sent to the author asking
him to manually group his patches.

This should be a pretty rare case given that most people will use some
generators like 'git format-patch' or 'quilt' for their patch-series.
I'd say if such an error ever occurs, the series could be manually
fixed/resent. That way, you don't need to code some UI and the authors
who have not done a mistake won't need to take an extra step.

Kind regards,

People do use those tools and then change their mind. One can see
regularly patches like [5/4] or people drop a patch from the series, etc.

That isn't very user friendly and at least for the beginning the tool
needs to cope with the established and accepted workflow. Once the tool
gets part of the patch submission process stuff can be made more strict
if it is deemed necessary.

Looking back at my previous post I see that I haven't been very clear.
The intent is to automatically process sets that the bot can recognize
by itself (by looking at author + xx/yy info) and only have the manual
interface as a fallback mechanism.

Totally agree, the tool should support the developers, not the other way
around. However, humans are much better at pattern recognition than
computers, so it might be advantageous to have a mechanism whereby a
human can nudge the tool in the right direction.

I think this is a good guideline, but I think Joerg justified his
approach reasonably well:  his first attempt introduced a test failure
because it caused a previously spuriously passing test to fail.  His
choices are to resubmit this patch, marking the test todo_wine along
with an explanation, and follow up with the patch that really fixes
the test, or to submit the two combined.  I think both are reasonable
if the explanation is clear enough.

The rule clearly applies when a test was not spuriously passing
before, e.g. is marked todo_wine, but in cases when the test is
spuriously passing, the "tests must always pass" rule also comes into
play.  The tests must always pass rule takes precedence, making the
tests should only ever remove a todo_wine rule impossible to meet.

Message-ID: <t2ha71bd89a1004130850j8e54901r58c1061546b29508@mail.gmail.com>

Hi Ge,
when I was running patchwatcher, taking the number of patches
in the series helped more than it hurt.  (It's fairly frequent for
people to submit two patchsets, and fairly infrequent for the
second patchset to have the same number of patches.)
The darn interface needed babysitting, though, since
there were always malformed and/or partial series.

I think it'd be cool to have a UI where developers
could correct their detected patchsets if they don't
like what the automated extractor did.  That could
morph into a way of submitting patchsets in the
first place later on.

It'd also be cool if other tools - say, a buildbot or a patchwatcher -
could monitor the detected patchset stream
(to save them from having to maintain their own).

Actually we don't need a CPU emulator for 64 bit after all. There's a
project on Sourceforge that's gotten VM86 working in 64-bit Linux:
http://v86-64.sourceforge.net/

It claims to work with Wine.

Thanks Dan, I think we have a winner then: take the maximum patch
number into account.

I tend to get distracted every now and then by things my boss wants
me to do and don't always have time for babysitting bots, which is why
I kind of like the idea of giving control to the devs, so the whole
bot doesn't break down when I'm not available.
I can certainly imagine a future where patches would be submitted
through Alexandres patch tracker and send out to wine-patches from
there, instead of the patch tracker picking up emails. But for now,
it's probably most productive for everyone to adjust to the existing
workflow.

I'm always open to talk about integration.
One of the things that always kind of irked me about the Wine websites
is that each (including mine) has its own user management. I think
a central Wine LDAP server would be a good idea. I'll be adding LDAP
support to the testbot for internal VMware usage anyway.

How about this:

First check it the normal way, also taking the maximum patch number into 
account.

If a patch with a number higher than the maximum comes in that also 
changes tests, then you run the whole patchset again.

If a set is not complete after x hours after the last patch has been set 
(not the first), you either send a reminder to check it, or you just run 
the tests anyway, even with an incomplete patchset. If it fails, that 
could also be a good thing in case someone actually forgets a patch.

If there are two incomplete patchsets after x hours, and they would fit 
together perfectly, then merge them, and run the tests. If it fails, 
that means that the set(s) itself is/are invalid.

If someone sends a try 2 for a patch (with tests), run the whole set 
again (in case you weren't already doing that). This only after x hours 
or minutes, because there could be more patches coming. If it runs too 
early, or a try 3 for a different patch comes in, always use the last 
try in the next run. This shouldn't be a problem, because extra tests 
don't hurt (unless we get over 300 patches a day or something).

This would reduce work to a minimum, and shouldn't leave any patches 
behind. Also, in the time of waiting before running tests in case of 
invalid patchsets, one could still go to the UI to run them or change them.

It looks to me that you should fix the push button paint routine,
instead of changing the notification type.

Hi,

While running your changed tests on Windows, I think I found new failures.
Being a bot and all I'm not very good at pattern recognition, so I might be
wrong, but could you please double-check?
Full results can be found at

Indeed. Thanks, fixed.
Also, I wouldn't pay much attention to the msi test results, it's one of the few DLLs where testing doesn't produce consistent results.

Yep, looks like a false positive. I see no new failures on 64-bit
Windows:

I'm not sure I see how that's going to make things better.

Hi,

While running your changed tests on Windows, I think I found new failures.
Being a bot and all I'm not very good at pattern recognition, so I might be
wrong, but could you please double-check?
Full results can be found at

Do you mean that the push button paint proc should be changed to paint focus rect
in the case of ODA_SELECT as well as ODA_DRAWENTIRE? I didn't want to do that because
all button painting procs have similar logic for drawing the focus, and it seemed
safe enough to change ODA_SELECT to ODA_DRAWENTIRE in the BM_SETSTATE handler.
I see now that UB_Paint relies on ODA_SELECT, and perhaps ODA_SELECT should be
passed to BS_USERBUTTON, and ODA_DRAWENTIRE to everyone else for BM_SETSTATE.

Subject: Future implementation
Message-ID: <4BC54602.5090003@ilidium.com>

Could someone please confirm the following points?:

1. Sound system. The configuration that wine will implement is:
winmm --> WASAPI --> OpenAL
and
DirectSound --> OpenAL
After that is done wineoss, winejack, winealsa, ... will be removed from 
the tree.

2. Integration of DosBOX or other emulator. How this will be done? Is 
the plan to use them when wine detects that the programme is compiled 
for real mode? Does that mean that the sake of wine is to provide 
compatibility only for applications built to be run on protected mode?

3. Direct3D10 and Direct3D11, Is there a target date for them?

I can't speak for the Developers That Matter (TM), but I don't think
there is any plan to remove wineoss, winejack and winealsa from the
tree completely. I think it's more likely that wineopenal will be
available (probably as default in the long term) as an alternative.

I certainly haven't heard of any plans to include an emulator in Wine.

Work has already begun, but Wine as a project generally does not set
target dates for any feature support.

Wine also runs on BSD and OpenSolaris, so if OSS was removed it would kill
sound support on these platforms.

Doesn't openal support bsd and solaris too?

Yes, but in their current ports (last I checked), the version is not
new enough for wine to support.

Just yesterday (http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2010-April/082983.html)
I wrote that we don't need emulation even on 64-bit since we can still
get into virtual 8086 mode using the http://v86-64.sourceforge.net
project.

In any case, a real mode DOS application can still switch into
protected mode, and a 16-bit protected mode Windows 3.1 application
can still call into DOS, so there's no escape from DOS in Wine :-).

And yesterday ;) I wanted to reply that Wine cannot rely on that
feature. That stuff is a kernel patch in the early stage. Provided that
Linus is willing to accept that feature it is at least 2 kernel versions
out; I see it earliest in 2.6.36 aka 1 year from now. And it will take
another 6-12 month until that feature is generally available in Linux
distributions. Also the non-Linux OSes would need to provide a similar
functionality too.

16bit Windows applications do run in Wine on a 64bit OS without any need
for VM86.

Thanks for your great work!

You have worked on quite a few bugs I have voted for. Would be buying

Well, mostly to have the sync conditions and the way we sync in a single place. That'll make it easier to use more suited GL methods to order draws, e.g. sharing one context across multiple threads on OSX.

Maybe, although I'm not at all convinced we want to go there. However,
making a function out of that line isn't going to work very well when
you've got both

> +            wglFlush(); /* Flush to ensure ordering across contexts. */

Perhaps those should be the same, but that's way past the goal of this
patch, all it's trying to do is to ensure there are no regressions
compared to before ce42470138a4805dce509a1fa806c8880530f324. I also
don't think that e.g. the num_contexts check is very helpful, because
at that point you've already got two contexts, but didn't flush for
any potential previous draws. This patch simply isn't trying to fix
those things.

Feel free to work on trying to fix that, but I think it's more useful
to work on a more structural solution.

In principle, yes. Though in all fairness it should also be noted that
Wine is the work of many people, not all of them employed by
CodeWeavers, not all of them developers, and we build on each other's
work.

Subject: HLSL Compiler and d3dcompiler_xx.dll
Message-ID: <z2kd8269d911004140408t39f76855u9e07677bbdf83c96@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I'm about to implement the HLSL compiler, but I want to make sure I'm
taking the right direction.
For the compiler:
preprocessor(wpp)->hlslparser/compiler(lex/bison)->bytecode
writer(same as for the shader assembler).
Now the question is where to implement the compiler. It can be called
from at least 3 places, d3dx9_xx, d3d10_xx and d3dcompiler_xx.
It seems to me that d3dx9_xx and d3d10_xx are forwarding their calls
to d3dcompiler_xx.
My proposal is:
1) Create the d3dcompiler_xx.dll structure in wine. Is it legal to use
a program like dll export viewer to get the exported functions for
each dll?
2) Move the assembler to d3dcompiler_xx.dll and forward calls from
d3dx9. This is needed because the assembler and compiler can share the
same bytecode writer this way.
3) Implement the compiler in d3dcompiler_xx.

Regards,

Matijn

In earlier d3dx9 versions the compiler was part of d3dx9, but at some
point Microsoft introduced d3dcompiler. I think it makes sense to
switch to the same scheme in Wine. Note that d3dcompiler is (somewhat)
documented at http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd607340%28v=VS.85%29.aspx

Hi Joel,

I think this has been mentioned before, but the monitor icons (32-bit 
and 8-bit for size 32) show a wider lower half of the monitor compared 
to the upper half (I think the 32-bit size 22 as well).

I've heard feedback about the screen colour before, which I've resolved. Never
any queries about the shape of the screen. The reason it's slightly wider at the
top to the bottom is that it is drawn in perspective, which is how the screen is
drawn in the Tango base set. I believe only The 48px-32bit and 48px-8bit have
this.

I let others judge whether this is ok, it's just something I noticed.

Especially the 8-bit version does look a bit weird though.

Oh, and while you're at it: the certerror.bmp and smallicons.bmp still 
use the no entrance sign instead of the cross from oic_hand.ico. IIRC 
people found this confusing or something.

When Mattheo implemented the assembler in the gsoc project we decided to put the assembler into d3dx9 because we assumed MS implements it there as well, and there are no assembler specific exports in d3dcompiler.dll. Using wine-internal exports is generally a bad idea and should only be used if there are clear advantages. (It e.g. makes it impossible to use the native d3dcompiler.dll with builtin d3dx9)

Before moving the assembler into d3dcompiler.dll we have to be sure that sharing the bytecode writer is possible and is worth the problems it introduces.

I wrote a basic HLSL compiler as university project in 2008, this is where part of the assembler code came from. Do you have the sources, do you need them?

In the last two versions of d3dcompiler (41 & 42), there's an
undocumented export D3DAssemble, which makes me assume that MS has
moved the Assembler there too. We can define D3DAssemble just like
D3DXAssembleShader for now, and once Microsoft documents this function
(or defines in d3dcompiler.h), we can adjust the definition if needed.

I'm not sure why sharing the bytecode writer wouldn't be possible. If
the shader assembler is moved along, there shouldn't be problems (or
am I missing something?).

Matteo told me about it, and he was going to send your code to me
after he checked if it was ok with you. But if you can send them to me
directly, that's fine too, of course.

Quite frankly, I also believe that's where some of the issues in the
early versions of those assembler patches came from. I don't know if
that compiler has seen any work since 2008, but I'd be careful with
taking it as too much of an example.

Yep, I recommend using Mattheo's code if possible. He has rebased my old code and fixed a bunch of issues. Beyond that, my compiler is fairly minimalistic. I think it supports most features except arrays(needs loop unrolling support). However, the optimizer is fairly simplistic. For better optimizations you may want to investigate SSA transformations and related stuff. I guess perfect optimization isn't a requirement for a first version though.

Just in case my git tree is here: http://84.112.174.163/~stefan/wine/ . It's not online all the time, and I am not guaranted a fixed IP(although it hasn't changed in years), so check it out as long as you can if you need it.

First thing would probably be cleaning up and getting something minimal past AJ.

Am I supposed to find your compiler code there? It seems like a git
tree of ages ago (where d3dx9_36 only contains math and font code).

It might also make sense to explore whether compilers like LLVM (used
a lot these days including for OpenCL implementations by Apple,
Nvidia; and don't forget Gallium3D) and Open64 (used in Cuda) and
others.

I have thought about using LLVM, but I don't like it because of:
1) Having another wine dependency (~40MB for me on ubuntu)
2) Code generated by LLVM will most likely not generated exactly the
same bytecode as native compiler does, even though the shader has same
effect on both. This makes it really hard to verify the HLSL compiler
is working. My idea was to make wine's hlsl compiler produce exactly
the same bytecode as native does. We might even find bugs in the
native compiler, and either fix or duplicate these bugs.

LLVM might be useful if we needed a really fast compiler, but native
compiler isn't really fast AFAIK. Once games are calling it a few
hundred times it might be worth the effort.

Of course the compile should be fixed instead.

I agree that an extra dependency should be avoided if possible.
Remember that if we use some generic framework (if it makes sense)
they would do a lot of hard work for us (especially optimizations
later on). Further other projects might want to help as well (there is
some XNA project for mono which wants a HLSL but there are likely
others as well). The 40MB is not a big deal, disk space is really
cheap these days.

I don't know much details about the HLSL compiler but I think this is
nearly impossible. I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft has added more
and more tweaks to each new revision of the HLSL compiler, so creating
100% the same code is hard. I think we need very strict d3dx9 test
cases which don't necessarily check the bytecode (in simple cases you
can) but which check whether the shader when fed with data works
correctly.

My main worry is that in the end if we use a compiler framework
(remember we don't have a lot of manpower for this) I think it would
reduce in more efficient shaders and it prevents some reinventing of
the wheel.

You're changing what we test here. If you only want to fix tests on 
win98 it's a nice excuse to skip tests. If you want to test 
CLSID_InternetSecurityManager anyway, you should test both 
CLSID_InternetSecurityManager  and CoInternetCreateSecurityManager. Same 
for zone manager patch.

Yeah, Stefan's project is based on wine 1.1.0 and you can find the
relevant code into dlls/wineshader. One of the things I did was to
port the assembler to current wine and move it into d3dx9_36.dll. In
the process I changed quite some things all around and I stripped from
the bytecode writer what wasn't needed by the assembler. I didn't
update the compiler code, and as Henri said, at this point probably
it's better to just continue what you are doing and look at Stefan's
implementation only as a "source for inspiration".
As d3dcompiler_xx.dll now seems to contain also the assembler, I'm ok
to move the assembler there (once completed) to share the bytecode
writer with the compiler.

Regarding the optimization, I'd suggest to keep it simple in the
beginning. I liked the idea in Stefan's compiler to have a parser
which produces an abstract intermediate representation, which is then
optimized to generate the bwriter_shader. The optimizer could then be
implemented from scratch, or using something third-party as LLVM or
such, while as a first step the optimizer could (ideally) simply spit
out the code unchanged. I believe that some language features cannot
be supported without some "optimizations", so this problem can crop up
sooner than expected.

Lastly, a bit on testing the compiler. I'm not sure trying to get
exactly the same bytecode as native is a feasible objective: while for
an assembler program there is only one correct translation, this is
not true for a compiler. Moreover I expect each iteration of the
Microsoft compiler could produce a different output with the same
shader program, so there isn't a "right" implementation to compare
with. I agree, this makes testing the compiler much harder...

dlls/wineshader doesn't exist in that tree?

That's the direction I wanted to take indeed. The optimizer should at
some point optimize according to the flag setting. At first, I would
only create test cases with D3DXSHADER_SKIPOPTIMIZATION.

I think that with a lot of testing, the logic behind can be figured
out. Then the compiler can be built around this logic. This could
possibly even work for a lot of optimizations.

I'm still not convinced it's worth the effort. Also, I think that a
parser/compiler written in lex/bison is much easier for other
developers to understand and maintain once it is in the tree (And
probably also a lot easier to review patches).

My understanding was that LLVM is written in C++, so cannot be used
directly in Wine (which only allows C89 code).

Therefore, for it to be usable in Wine, the LLVM API will need to be
wrapped in a C API.

Not entirely trivial, since the compile is broken for gcc in c99 mode as well:

Check if you are in the correct branch (should be the "compiler"
branch in his tree).

What I mean is that there could not be a single logic behind, I expect
to find differences between the various d3dcompiler_xx dlls,
expecially regarding the optimizations. You could just pick a version
to compare against and try to stick with that, but maybe this is not
the best thing to do.
On the other hand, with optimizations disabled maybe this doable (but
then you aren't testing the optimizer).

But LLVM *is* wrapped in a C API. (The headers are in include/llvm-c
from the LLVM source root.)

The real problem is that if we use LLVM, we'll have to write a backend
to generate shader bytecode, and LLVM backends have to be written in C++
(actually, you write description files that get turned into C++ code).
Personally, I think that should be a separate project anyway.

It was briefly discussed when I wrote about implementing VGA mode 18. 
This does require a lot of changes in the DOSVM (another mail incoming 
about that).
It was seen as a way of making more real mode programs run without 
having to redo what others have already done.
But doing so present it's own set of problems. For me the main thing 
would be how to tell the user that they are now "leaving" wine and what 
ever error that might come should be directed at someone else.

So for me the way forward is still to improve wine's dosvm to handle 
more cases. Something I hope I can devote some time to.

It should be same as the latest version available (currently version
42). Changes in the logic when a new version comes out will be caught
by test cases. We probably shouldn't directly fail, but perhaps mark
it todo_wine when it fails with newer version?

I think you want to test if the compiled shader works instead of the
exact bytecode. Generating the same bytecode is probably way too hard,
fragile to test, and most likely not worth the effort.

I'm not sure about LLVM. On one hand I don't think we want to be
writing and maintaining all the optimizations that LLVM can do inside
the d3d compiler dll. On the other hand, it would be a pretty large
dependency, and it's not clear if it would gain us anything at all.
It's not entirely unlikely that if the driver we're running on has a
good GLSL compiler we're not going to see much of a benefit from
generating good d3d bytecode. (I can already hear the Mesa people
laughing about that one though.) Either way, it would probably already
be a good start to have a parser, and generate some basic unoptimized
bytecode from that, or even just print an AST.

Also remember that perhaps based on gpu capabilities (even on
different SM3.0 capable GPUs) some different code might get generated.

One good reason for not having the same code is vertex / pixel shader
constants. For some games d3d9x selects uniforms constants which are
close to the SM3.0 limits (wined3d eats a number of constants) and
this can cause major issues especially on Geforce6/7 and AMD cards
(even modern AMD cards only report SM3.0 limits using glsl; you need
UBOs to get more). When we have our own compiler we can 'schedule' the
constants in such a way that we might be able to avoid these issues.
This leads to different shaders.

It is not something to worry about now. I think you just want to focus
on rendering tests to see if the shader does the right thing.

I think I should go for exact bytecode as long as it is possible, it's
the only way we can be sure the implementation is 100% right for each
test case.

Right, it's probably better to go ahead first, and implement LLVM once
we find it necessary (if ever).

I think, for now, we should pass D3DXSHADER_SKIPVALIDATION to the
compiler, so the code won't be checked for GPU capabilities. I'm not
sure if different code is generated when GPU capabilities are low, but
I think it's safe to fail if we request too many constants. In test
cases we could check D3DCAPS9 and skip if needed.

Yep, comparing generated bytecode is not going to work. I think I wrote only 3-4 HLSL tests in the compiler, and all those were based on checking the rendering results, similar to the d3d9 visual tests.

My main concern about LLVM in 2008 was that it wasn't capable of some shader specific things like DDX and DDY. Apple only used it to optimize CPU fallback code, not to optimize code sent to the GPU. This might have changed since then, especially if the Gallium3D developers indeed use LLVM, as they planned in the past. I recommend to contact the Mesa developers about their compiler status and plans.

If we can it's certainly an advantage to use an existing compiler engine like LLVM instead of reinventing the wheel. I doubt that the dependency is a big issue. It will probably be required by Mesa as well, so distros will install it anyway. LLVM is available on OSX too.

If we're extra-lucky we can implement the parser and bytecode writer ourselves, and just send the parse tree to LLVM and get an optimized tree back. So LLVM could be optional. If you have it great, otherwise things will still work, but shaders will be less efficient.

HLSL is both a simple and complicated language. In many ways it is easier than average imperative programming language because it doesn't have pointers, references or similar features. In d3d9 it had pretty much no types(only floats, except in special cases). Then there are issues that make things more complicated, for example the special address registers, vector registers and no memory to push/pop registers. If your register allocator can't fit the program in the existing registers you're out of luck.

However, pointers are appearing in GLSL via extensions, and I guess in HLSL it's only a matter of time(maybe dx11 compute shaders...).

FYI, we encountered a game a while back which used a few shaders that depended on being compiled with a particular version for d3dx9_##.dll.  There was a compiler bug which the game engine knew about and accounted for.  If you tried to use the compiled shader from a newer d3dx9_##.dll, then the rendering wouldn't look quite right on certain objects.

So, there's one argument for identical bytecode compatibility, but it's likely that very few apps will exhibit behavior like this.

I am not sure where you're going with this. User-space software only
interacts with a device using a driver, and only interacts with that
driver, at the lowest level, using I/O operations like ReadFile,
WriteFile, DeviceIoControl, etc. You could write a driver to simulate
a device but you don't need any USB functions for that.

This looks like a workaround. I don't think you should hard code it this 
way, what's so special with this format?
And what is a initial problem with that?

The function is badly named. It doesn't "boycott" PA but doesn't uses it

The date and time parsing is locale dependent of course, but the code is mainly written for english.
There was a bug so i fixed it and introduced a regression and bug 22287 came up.

I noticed a problem with the icons in Wine when alt+tabbing today.  After
doing a regression test it appears that commit
c29cf0591976f96c3adb30c3c3b6db59f4983251 results in pixmaps that do not
always display properly when alt+tabbing (see attached screenshot).

You need to test CompareStringW instead, and try to avoid using any macros at all.
Probably the very first thing you need to do in the test is to call GetStringType
and verify that the character you want to test is supported and has the expected
attributes.

Subject: Packaging Wine 64bit
Message-ID: <4BC63B0E.4090506@redhat.com>

Hello guys!

Wine 64bit (the one able to run 64bit Windows application) is nearly 
feature complete. As of wine-1.1.42 Wine supports shared 32/64-bit 
setups; though we do not recommend it yet for general consumption. This 
is more of a "heads up" info as the next stable Wine release aka 1.2 is 
"imminent" (about one month until code freeze and then an additional 
month for the stabilization period).

Proper Wine 64bit support poses some challenges for packaging as it 
requires *both* 64bit as well as 32bit libraries and binaries. This 
makes Wine 64bit packaging different from the normal other 64bit 
packages. To ease the pain we have created a wiki page with information 
pertinent to packagers/distributions:
     http://wiki.winehq.org/Wine64ForPackagers

Do not hesitate to contact us either by email to wine-devel or on irc on 
Freenode in #winehackers if you have any questions or suggestions. The 
above page actually evolved from discussions on irc.


If you do know about Wine packagers on other Linux distributions please 
forward them this info; we are pretty sure that we missed a few.
We didn't forget about the non-Linux OSes but Wine 64bit is at the 
moment a Linux only feature; patches to change that are of course welcome ;)

bye
	michael

I think it's only an argument that we may need some specific tests that check for identical bytecode. And by your description it sounds like the compiler bug can be detected by looking at the rendering output. I still think that having the majority of tests check the generated bytecode is a bad idea:

* It will be hard to implement the same compiler result
* It will make our own optimizations impossible(the MS compiler is very good optimization wise, so that point is mostly moot)
* It will be hard to maintain the tests when we're moving them to a newer MS compiler version
* There are things that can be translated into different bytecodes, and all are equally valid and optimal, like constants ordering.

Yes, but that doesn't mean it should be hard coded this way. Am I right 
it should use localized format and try to fit input in it?
If so, this should be fixed in a general way.

Hi,

any comment on that patch? It's currently the bottommost in
source.winehq.org/patches hence may fall into the bitbucket anytime.

I had noticed that the MCI MIDI player would busy loop while paused
because of a while(xyz) ; statement therein.

Test it using these MCI commands
open c:\data\foo.mid alias m
play m
pause m

So I simply added a Sleep() and wrote:
>7 ms is arbitrary. It allows to sleep well yet be responsive enough
>so the app doesn't wait too long should the next command be MCI_Stop.
>For the ear, an even larger sleep would be good enough.

Sleep is a sort of stop gap until someone invents a
notification/setEvent/Resume patch or whatever would be TRT.

 J?rg H?hle

It would be better to signal an event object to wake up from sleep.

That's the notepad window in the compiz alt+tab dialog (everything except
the window icon gets scaled).  The key feature is that in the bottom right
corner the icon for the window is really messed up (black with a few dots of
color).  It's also worth noting that the window icon does not display in the
gnome taskbar at all after this patch, just a generic "this program has no
icon" icon.  I'm using the nVidia driver version 185.18.36.

And by your description it sounds like the compiler bug can be detected by looking at the rendering output. I still think that having the majority of tests check the generated bytecode is a bad idea:

As long as it is possible, I think we should do.

Tests should fail if a newer version of MS compiler is used and
different code is produced. Or, if you prefer, win_skip if version is
newer than what the tests expect.

Same as your first concern.

This causes the test to not restore the display mode properly on exit.

It seems to me this should go in programs/attrib. Also it should test
that the attributes actually changed.

I looked into this a little and it appears like it's necessary to use the
extended window manager hint _NET_WM_ICON to use 32-bit window icons.  I've
whipped up a small patch (attached) that does this and it fixes the problem
I'm seeing (both with alt+tab and in the gnome taskbar), does this solution
appear acceptable?

C99's inline differs from GNU C's in that it will never cause a function
definition to be emitted, so you should be able to replace GNU C's "extern
inline" with plain inline.

This has an advantage over static inline if you need to define an
externally visible function, since you can avoid the copying the definition
from the header to a source file by making sure the translation unit
declares the function as C99 extern inline before including the inline
definition.

With C99 static inline, there should be no function definitions emitted so
the size should not be much different.

Thanks for helping Wine get closer to C standards conformance!

Hi.

Could someone please tell me why this patch was silently discarded ?
Is there some something awfully wrong in the
changes in tools/Makefile.in ?

Or some other trivial mistake ?

Hi Detlef,

After this patch none of the tests are actually run on W95B and we have 
loads of win_skip's.

Wouldn't it be better to just check for one (or all) and bail out with a 
(only one) win_skip()? I guess if one is not present, none are?

Obviously this patch and the same for 4/4 can be dropped. I'm still a
bit new to git send-email and my out directory wasn't empty, so it
picked these two up.

Hi,

Maarten recently mapped winmm:timeGetTime to kernel32.GetTickCount
This rang a bell and now I found again the article where I read about it:

http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2009/09/02/what-s-the-difference-between-gettickcount-and-timegettime.aspx

"So why are all these multimedia APIs using timeGetTime and not GetTickCount
since the two APIs apparently return the same value? ...
The answer is that they don?t."

I cannot judge whether what's described there applies to Wine's timing.
However the listed timings prove both values are different.

FWIW, I've determined long ago that timer increments in MS suffer
from a 15.625ms granularity.  This affects almost all applications
in MS-Windows.  For instance, JMeter(Java) always returns times that
are multiple of this value, plus/minus rounding.  It will tell you
jobs took 15, 16, 31, 32, 46 or 47ms etc.  Never 5, 12, 26 or 30ms!
You can't use it to time short jobs.
I've seen the same values in many other apps (not just Java) and
several versions of MS-Windows.
Heck, 46 and 47ms are even shown in the above URL in the dTicks column
(as well as the next pair: 62 and 63ms).

Whatever you measure, you'll encounter this 15.625ms increment.
Presumably, the high performance counters are not affected.  But
few apps seem to use these.

What's 15.625ms?  Exactly 64 ticks per second
... and the linearisation of all returned values.

If you GetTickCount something that truly takes 29ms multiple times,
you'll observe 31/32 deltas much more often than 15/16. (As the article
says: "note that the deltas average to 55ms").

Regards,
 J?rg H?hle

That looks quite inefficient, not to mention not thread-safe. It would
be better to reimplement these functions, that's not hard.

Subject: ICM tests and top-down DIB
Message-ID: <47CC5ABB01651443A88DB8EC5B4D657B740335@S4DE8PSAANK.mitte.t-com.de>

Hi,

any suggestions about how could one reasonably test the ICM codecs?
I found no test at all in Wine (but the 4 Austin and I once wrote).

I was considering adding the ability to deal with a negative
biHeight values (native amstream seems to use this to work around bug
#17893) but I feel uncomfortable at touching the always
sensitive graphics area without good tests to start with.
Upside-down support in the codecs could start a landslide in other places.

Negative biHeight indicates top-down bitmaps, see
http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd183376.aspx

Grepping through dlls/* revealed only few places that deal with them.

Thanks for your help,
 J?rg H?hle.

Hey,
you might take that as spam, but i just saw that Wine seems to be used for the Linux Version of http://www.teamviewer.com
I did not yet had a look if they use wine64 for their 64-bit packages...

lib32 is almost never used in the Linux distros though

e.g. for SUSE:
/usr/lib is the 32bit path on x86, ppc, s390
/usr/lib64 the 64bit path  on x86_64, ppc64, s390x

Just ia64 is an exception and has /usr/lib (and the compat libs somewhere weird).

Ciao, Marcus

That's great for Linux, FreeBSD, etc., but in a world of universal
binaries (read: Mac OS X), this ain't gonna fly. I'm pretty sure that
when 64-bit Wine support does come to Mac OS X, people are going to want
to build it universal (i.e. 32-bit and 64-bit binaries in the same
file); I know I do.

Fran?ois,
what was the exact issue here ? I guess that the ; at the end of the 
attribute definition for GNUCC compiler was missing for the non gnu C 
compilers ?
your fix is wrong as dbg_printf doesn't take a va_list as argument 
(you'd want dbg_vprintf which doesn't exist)
does the attached patch work in your configuration ?

A+

I think I read it somewhere that it is a debian-ism. on x86_64 debian, 64-bits libraries  are in /lib, and 32-bits are in /lib32 .
