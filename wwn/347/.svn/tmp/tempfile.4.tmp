<intro> <p>This is the 347 issue of the Wine Weekly News publication.
Its main goal is to  It also serves to inform you of what's going on around Wine. Wine is an open source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.  Think of it as a Windows compatibility layer.  Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely alternative implementation consisting of 100% Microsoft-free code, but it can optionally use native system DLLs if they are available.

Wine is well on its way to hitting 1.0 with two release candidates already being published.  Alexandre's usual little blurb of changes is significantly shortened for both of these releases:

<p>
<i>Brian Vincent and I have been conspiring to bring the Wine community some insights from some of the more well known and established members of the Wine Development community!  We're going to try and have at least one interview posted each week up until the 1.0 release!  We asked our targets the same set of 10 questions designed to try and get at some of their key thought processes and we present to you their responses each week.
</i>
</p>

<p>
1.  It's been a pretty long road to 1.0.  Do you think Wine should
have tried to have a release based on any of the older versions over
the years?  If so, at what point or points do you think Wine should
have tried to have a release?  Why?  Do you think the actual 1.0
release is at an appropriate time?
</p>
<quote who="Jeremy White">
<p>
I think we've gotten it about right.  There has been a lot of
infrastructure work that hasn't been all that user visible that
means that Wine is far more robust and capable than it ever used to be.

Arguably, we should wait until the DIB Engine is done, so maybe we're
even a few months early *grin*.

The interesting side note is that releasing a 1.0 is going to create
a new burden for Wine - backwards compatibility.  Historically, Wine developers
have been free to make 'correct' changes, even if they broken many
applications.  With 1.0, I think we will be honor bound to constrain
that, if only on a stable 1.X branch.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
2.  What highlights do you think we should point out about 1.0?  I
mean, now that we're here, shouldn't we be standing on the rooftops
shouting, "We can do [this]!".  What is [this]?  If someone wanted to
go take Wine for a spin, are there any Windows programs out there
you'd recommend they try out?  There's still a ton of Windows apps
with no comparable Linux version, are there any in particular you find
useful that you'd suggest someone try?
</p>

<quote who="Jeremy White">
<p>
If I look back on my time with Wine (about 10 years now), this is the
most exciting Wine has ever been.  When I first started, the only
thing you could *always* run was Solitaire.  Other things could be
made to work, but it took a lot of effort.

Contrast that with today when, with few exceptions, it's reasonable
to hope that *any* application will work.  And, in practice, a substantial
fraction of applications do install and run.  (I don't know what that number
is; I don't have a good way to quantify it).  The WineHQ ratings page
suggests it's close to 75% run at least as bronze:
<a href="http://appdb.winehq.org/browse_by_rating.php">http://appdb.winehq.org/browse_by_rating.php</a>
(I think that page over inflates things, but I think that 50% is not
a bad rough estimate for applications that install and at least start
to work).
</p>
</quote>
<p>
3a.  Looking ahead, what technical changes do you see Wine needing?
Are there any large patch sets that are already sitting out there that
haven't been merged because of the code freeze?
</p>

<quote who="Jeremy White">
<p>

The DIB Engine is the big one.  Huw is hard at work on that, but it will
have to be a post 1.0 thing.

Beyond that, we need to get .NET taken care of, and GdiPlus needs some love.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
3b. We've had a few different groups driving Wine development for a Wine,
namely Google and CodeWeavers.  What do you guys have planned for
areas of focus? Over the years we've seen quite a few large changes that
have moved Wine in very different directions - for example, D3D8
development really ushered in a new era of gaming support for Wine,
the port to OS X has really opened the door on portability, is there
anything like that on the horizon?  Do you ever think someone will have
ntoskrnl loading Windows drivers or hooking into the kernel or something
like that?
</p>

<quote who="Jeremy White">
<p>
On the Mac side, the only really radical transformation will come
from a Quartz driver - eliminating the use of X11 altogether.

That's a big, scary job, with a lot of testing requirements, so I don't
think it's going to be particularly soon.

Other than that, I actually think the shift to 1.0 is going to be more
trans formative than people realize.  For example, having make test
fail for most people is interesting when we're in alpha mode.  But if we're
shipping a release product I think it's nonsense, and we have to fix it.
The work that Dan is doing with Valgrind is another such subtle, but
important, change.  If we can get oprofile and maybe some cxtest work
into the mix, I think the whole approach for Wine can change.

I guess the short, user visible way of saying that, is that with Wine 1.0
I would hope that Wine would become less 'variable'; fewer occurrences of
regressions from release to release.  And that will be a big deal.


</p>
</quote>
<p>
4.  What don't we want to do?  What technical things shouldn't we
worry about?  Are there any parts of Windows that aren't worth trying
to support?  For example, Win31 support hangs on tenuously at this
point, is there ever a point where it's not worth supporting?  Or does
Wine fill a valuable role in that it allows legacy applications to be
usable?
</p>

<quote who="Jeremy White">
<p>

Well, what's beautiful about being open source is that we don't have to
choose; if anyone has a passion for a given area, they can make it happen.

I think the core goal remains the same:  get just about all application
level (i.e. not hardware related) applications to install and run.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
5.  Is Wine too ambitious?  Are we trying to tackle something too big?
Will there ever be a point where the
complexity of the project combined with the regression rate isn't
manageable by the size of our developer community?  At one point about
a decade ago it seemed like Microsoft was releasing new technologies
and new API's every week.  Things seemed to have really slowed down,
but do you think that that trend will continue? Do you think we'll be able
to keep up with future APIs with Vista, Windows 7 etc?
</p>
<quote who="Jeremy White">
<p>
Yes, Wine is too ambitious, and what's worse, it's under appreciated.
We're just like Rodney Dangerfield - we get no respect.

You show someone Wine running MS Office - which is a technological
miracle, and the results of the incredible hard work of a small
band of dedicated people - and they ho-hum, because it's something
they see every day.

As far as keeping up, I'm not sure.  I think so, but only because
we're not so much keeping up with MS as we're keeping up with the ISVs.

In theory, at some point, all new apps will be 'in the cloud', and
then Wine will become an interesting retro technology, right?

<p>
6a.  If you could wave your magic wand and change one thing about
Wine, what would it be?
</p>

<quote who="Jeremy White">
<p>
I would want Wine to have simpler debugging tools.  That is,
when application X fails, I want a simple way to go learn why.
We can fix failures quickly when we understand them; all of our
energy goes into understanding the failures, though.  That alone,
I think, would double our rate of progress.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
6b.  If you could wave your magic wand and change one thing about
Linux [or OS X], what would it be?
</p>

<quote who="Jeremy White">
<p>
For Linux, I want it to have 10x market share.  Then the demand
for Wine would be 10x greater...


</p>
</quote>
<p>
6c.  If you could wave your magic wand and change one thing about
Windows, what would it be?
</p>

<quote who="Jeremy White">
<p>
Let me tap my heels together, and wish that:
 When they hired David Cutler of Vax/VMS fame to write Windows NT
that they had also gotten the same magic pixie dust that went into VMS
documentation so that Windows had the same level of quality documentation
that VMS had.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
7.  Now that Wine has hit 1.0, do you think the major distros will
bundle Wine?  If not, why?  Are they scared of lawsuits?  If so,
should they be?
</p>

<quote who="Jeremy White">
<p>
Gosh, I don't know; doesn't SuSE already bundle it, and it's trivial
to get in Ubuntu, right?

 I think the key for the distros is that they really want to emphasize
native Linux programs, and I think that's healthy.  If you can run a
native Linux application, you really should, imho.

 So providing Wine as an option lets them provide it, but still stick
with the message that their distro is all you really need.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
8.  We should ask this only because there's no better way to incite
violence than to start a flamewar on licensing, but do you see any
need to switch to LGPL3?  Most developers seem to be pretty happy with
version 2.  Then again, most people seemed happy with the X11 license
before we rather quickly changed our minds.  Is there anything within
the LGPL3 license that would particularly be a problem for Wine?
</p>

<quote who="Jeremy White">
<p>
I don't have strong feelings on the matter.  I like that the LGPL v3
tightens up the enforcement process (has specific mechanisms and timing);
I think that's all good.  But again, I don't feel strongly on it.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
9.  With 1.0 out, do you see the need for any process changes?  Will
patches still enter the Wine tree the way they have been?  Do you
think anything will change after 1.0 with regards to development
style?
</p>

<quote who="Jeremy White">
<p>
Good question.  Actually, I don't know what Alexandre is planning
here.  Are we going to have a stable branch?  Hmm.  I don't really know!
</p>
</quote>
<p>
10.  If we could magically add all the developers in the world
and have a Wine 2.0 this time next year, what would you want
to be included?
</p>

<quote who="Jeremy White">
<p>


 Ah, I have a long list.  But this is more of a question I muse on,
which is:  If I had a big bucket of money, what would I do?

And the reality is that a big bucket of money wouldn't solve the biggest
problem - having talented Wine developers.  It might help, but good Wine
developers are very rare, and I don't know that we can force them into
existence.

 But there are a lot of things I *could* do that would help Wine:

   I want make test to work perfectly on every
machine.  I want a perfect cxtest run for every freely downloadable
.exe file on the net, and run against every single patch, so no patch
goes in if it makes a regression.  I want valgrind and oprofile also
run routinely, and any bad results caught immediately.

<quote who="Marcus Meissner">

I think it is good the way it has worked out now.

That doing more releases might have worked we see with CrossOver Office,
which did releases regulary.
However this would have required all developers agreeing on doing so,
which would have been more difficult in earlier times.

Also, we have only two years ago or so reached the point where we
could admit Wine to be "BETA" quality, so earlier releases would likely
have been disappointing to users which later would have shied away
even more.

The good thing with 1.0 is now that we have a chance to convince
people that Wine is working and useful, and that further versions
are not "broken" but will improve.

I would say that they should just try the program they fancy, or a
program they run Windows for.

A friend of mine for instance tries all the MMORPG games he plays under
Windows also under Wine, and I have to go and try to fix them (not always
successful) before he goes playing the next one.

If they do not have any program the usually use, what about a
fun Windows game. Today for instance I found that the Webcomic
makers from Penny Arcade did a Game ... I downloaded it, installed
it and played it under Wine, without any hacks necessary. It stuttered
a bit and I usually do not like this realtime hack and slay, but
it worked, out of the box! (<a href="http://www.playgreenhouse.com/">http://www.playgreenhouse.com/</a>)
(And they have a Linux port too, I know ;)

.NET integration is one major thing which we need to implement.
I see this with my Tax program that previously even had a Wine based
Linux version but now no longer does since it is a mix between Win32
and .NET code.

Win64 is slowly coming and we will need to take that up too.

Don't forget Corel, but that was quite some years ago ;)

The group I belong to is probably the Distribution makers, working
for Novell/SUSE. We are not driving Wine in any kind of direction,
except perhaps just taking care of good integration into the distributions
themselves.

 4.  What don't we want to do?  What technical things shouldn't we
 worry about?  Are there any parts of Windows that aren't worth trying
 to support?  For example, Win31 support hangs on tenuously at this
 point, is there ever a point where it's not worth supporting?  Or does
 Wine fill a valuable role in that it allows legacy applications to be
 usable?
</p>
<quote who="Marcus Meissner">

We do not want to go all the way down to Windows kernel driver emulation.
DOS support is not really necessary in my eyes, but Win31 support is.
And yes, legacy applications are important too.

 5.  Is Wine too ambitious?  Are we trying to tackle something too big?
 Will there ever be a point where the
 complexity of the project combined with the regression rate isn't
 manageable by the size of our developer community?  At one point about
 a decade ago it seemed like Microsoft was releasing new technologies
 and new API's every week.  Things seemed to have really slowed down,
 but do you think that that trend will continue? Do you think we'll be able
 to keep up with future APIs with Vista, Windows 7 etc?
</p>
<quote who="Marcus Meissner">
<p>
I do not think that we are too ambitious. Also regressions come and go,
but the number of fixed bugs is higher than the number of regressions.
And by adding more testcases we are making sure that regressions become
less seldom and are easier to track down.

As for areas of improvement, people do things that they are interested in ...
See the games support:  People were interested in Games, started hacking
and improving on it and so it gained momentum.

Or developers get paid to do stuff, like the CodeWeavers work on DCOM/RPC or
Googles work across the tree for specific targeted applications.

 6a.  If you could wave your magic wand and change one thing about
 Wine, what would it be?

Magically add .NET support. :)

 7.  Now that Wine has hit 1.0, do you think the major distros will
 bundle Wine?  If not, why?  Are they scared of lawsuits?  If so,
 should they be?
</p>
<quote who="Marcus Meissner">
<p>
Novell/SUSE bundles it in the community product (SUSE Linux / openSUSE) for
over 10 years now, which will of course continue.

We also shipped CrossOver Office with a enterprise desktop distribution
4 years ago, but newer ones did not include.

For Enterprise products, yes there is a problem of lawsuits which
might make most of the distributors afraid I guess.
Also Distributors will point out that the native software they have
is ready for all uses, and without a direct use for Wine it will
be difficult to explain the costs.

Also up to now Wine was not really "supportable" in the way that
people could call the distributor and get bugs fixed. This would
have required contracts with companies like Codeweavers and would
have made the products more expensive.

 8.  We should ask this only because there's no better way to incite
 violence than to start a flamewar on licensing, but do you see any
 need to switch to LGPL3?  Most developers seem to be pretty happy with
 version 2.  Then again, most people seemed happy with the X11 license
 before we rather quickly changed our minds.  Is there anything within
 the LGPL3 license that would particularly be a problem for Wine?
</p>
<quote who="Marcus Meissner">
<p>
I see no need to change the license and have not thought about it further.

It was however necessary to change from X11 to LGPL to avoid more than
just the one major fork we had and so not to hinder development.

 9.  With 1.0 out, do you see the need for any process changes?  Will
 patches still enter the Wine tree the way they have been?  Do you
 think anything will change after 1.0 with regards to development
 style?
</p>
<quote who="Marcus Meissner">
<p>
There will be process changes, but mostly for the 1.0 stable tree
I guess. I can't really predict how Alexandre will do that.

The unstable tree likely will continue to be handled as before.

 10.  If we could magically add all the developers in the world
 and have a Wine 2.0 this time next year, what would you want
 to be included?
</p>
<quote who="Marcus Meissner">
<p>
See above ...
.Net support, even better games support, all Win32 applications
running ... :)

In the last WWN we had introductions from each of the Google Summer of Code students.  Some students had not yet written in with introductions; here are the remaining hello worlds!

Hello everyone,
</p>
<p>
My name is Dylan Smith, and I will be working on implementing tables in rich
edit controls as a Google Summer of Code project.  Any remaining time I have
will also be focused on rich edit controls for this summer.
</p><p>
Forgive me for taking so long to introduce myself on the developers mailing
list.  I ended up going straight for the code as soon as my exams finished. I
just finished my last year of Software Engineering at Carleton University which
is located in Ottawa, Canada.  I will be returning to Carleton University for
my Masters after the summer.
</p><p>
I am thrilled that I am getting this opportunity to work on Wine for the summer.
</p><p>
Happy coding to you all,<br />
Dylan
