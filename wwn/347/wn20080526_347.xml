<intro> <p>This is the 347 issue of the Wine Weekly News publication.
Its main goal is to  It also serves to inform you of what's going on around Wine. Wine is an open source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.  Think of it as a Windows compatibility layer.  Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely alternative implementation consisting of 100% Microsoft-free code, but it can optionally use native system DLLs if they are available.

Wine is well on its way to hitting 1.0 with two release candidates already being published.  Alexandre's usual little blurb of changes is significantly shortened for both of these releases:

<i>Brian Vincent and I have been conspiring to bring the Wine community some insights from some of the more well known and established members of the Wine Development community!  We're going to try and have at least one interview posted each week up until the 1.0 release!  We asked our targets the same set of 10 questions designed to try and get at some of their key thought processes and we present to you their responses each week.
</i>
</p>

<p>
1.  It's been a pretty long road to 1.0.  Do you think Wine should
have tried to have a release based on any of the older versions over
the years?  If so, at what point or points do you think Wine should
have tried to have a release?  Why?  Do you think the actual 1.0
release is at an appropriate time?
</p>
<p>
2.  What highlights do you think we should point out about 1.0?  I
mean, now that we're here, shouldn't we be standing on the rooftops
shouting, "We can do [this]!".  What is [this]?  If someone wanted to
go take Wine for a spin, are there any Windows programs out there
you'd recommend they try out?  There's still a ton of Windows apps
with no comparable Linux version, are there any in particular you find
useful that you'd suggest someone try?
</p>
<p>
3a.  Looking ahead, what technical changes do you see Wine needing?
Are there any large patch sets that are already sitting out there that
haven't been merged because of the code freeze?
</p>
<p>
3b. We've had a few different groups driving Wine development for a Wine,
namely Google and CodeWeavers.  What do you guys have planned for
areas of focus? Over the years we've seen quite a few large changes that
have moved Wine in very different directions - for example, D3D8
development really ushered in a new era of gaming support for Wine,
the port to OS X has really opened the door on portability, is there
anything like that on the horizon?  Do you ever think someone will have
ntoskrnl loading Windows drivers or hooking into the kernel or something
like that?
</p>
<p>
4.  What don't we want to do?  What technical things shouldn't we
worry about?  Are there any parts of Windows that aren't worth trying
to support?  For example, Win31 support hangs on tenuously at this
point, is there ever a point where it's not worth supporting?  Or does
Wine fill a valuable role in that it allows legacy applications to be
usable?
</p>
<p>
5.  Is Wine too ambitious?  Are we trying to tackle something too big?
Will there ever be a point where the
complexity of the project combined with the regression rate isn't
manageable by the size of our developer community?  At one point about
a decade ago it seemed like Microsoft was releasing new technologies
and new API's every week.  Things seemed to have really slowed down,
but do you think that that trend will continue? Do you think we'll be able
to keep up with future APIs with Vista, Windows 7 etc?
</p>
<p>
6a.  If you could wave your magic wand and change one thing about
Wine, what would it be?
6b.  If you could wave your magic wand and change one thing about
Linux [or OS X], what would it be?
6c.  If you could wave your magic wand and change one thing about
Windows, what would it be?
</p>
<p>
7.  Now that Wine has hit 1.0, do you think the major distros will
bundle Wine?  If not, why?  Are they scared of lawsuits?  If so,
should they be?
</p>
<p>
8.  We should ask this only because there's no better way to incite
violence than to start a flamewar on licensing, but do you see any
need to switch to LGPL3?  Most developers seem to be pretty happy with
version 2.  Then again, most people seemed happy with the X11 license
before we rather quickly changed our minds.  Is there anything within
the LGPL3 license that would particularly be a problem for Wine?
</p>
<p>
9.  With 1.0 out, do you see the need for any process changes?  Will
patches still enter the Wine tree the way they have been?  Do you
think anything will change after 1.0 with regards to development
style?
</p>
<p>
10.  If we could magically add all the developers in the world
and have a Wine 2.0 this time next year, what would you want
to be included?
