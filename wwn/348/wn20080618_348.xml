<intro> <p>This is the 348 issue of the Wine Weekly News publication.
Its main goal is to  It also serves to inform you of what's going on around Wine. Wine is an open source implementation of the Windows API on top of X and Unix.  Think of it as a Windows compatibility layer.  Wine does not require Microsoft Windows, as it is a completely alternative implementation consisting of 100% Microsoft-free code, but it can optionally use native system DLLs if they are available.

The official announcement:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
     The Wine team is proud to announce that Wine 1.0 is now available. This is the first stable release of Wine after 15 years of development and beta testing. Many thanks to everybody who helped us along that long road!
</p><p>
    While compatibility is not perfect yet, thousands of applications have been reported to work very well. Check <a href="http://appdb.winehq.org">http://appdb.winehq.org</a> to see the details for your favorite applications.
</p><p>
    The source is available now. Binary packages are in the process of being built, and will appear soon at their respective download locations.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
The release caused an inevitable inundation of web surfers hitting winehq.org and downloading the big release.  So much so that <a href="http://www.winehq.org">http://www.winehq.org</a> was offline for an hour or two during the worst of the storm.  You can browse winehq.org's <a href="http://winehq.org/webalizer/">web stats</a> if your interested in checking out the curve.
</p>
<p>
The day after 1.0 Alexandre Julliard began committing patches at a normal rate.  As of the time of this writing there have already been more than 150 patches sent into the mailing list.

<topic>Wine 1.0</topic>
<p>
<i>Brian Vincent and I have been conspiring to bring the Wine community some insights from some of the more well known and established members of the Wine Development community!  We're going to try and have at least one interview posted each week up until the 1.0 release!  We asked our targets the same set of 10 questions designed to try and get at some of their key thought processes and we present to you their responses each week.
</i>
</p>

<p>
1.  It's been a pretty long road to 1.0.  Do you think Wine should
have tried to have a release based on any of the older versions over
the years?  If so, at what point or points do you think Wine should
have tried to have a release?  Why?  Do you think the actual 1.0
release is at an appropriate time?
</p>
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
<p>
Initially Wine only supported Win16 since it started in the Windows 3.1
days, and we could probably have made a release with pretty good Win16
support sometime in 1998 or so. But of course at that point everybody
wanted to run 32-bit apps, so to concentrate on Win16 support to bring
it to release would probably have caused many developers to lose
interest. Instead we started re-architecting things to support Win32,
which in the long run was the right choice, but meant that we couldn't
release anything decent for a long time.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
2.  What highlights do you think we should point out about 1.0?  I
mean, now that we're here, shouldn't we be standing on the rooftops
shouting, "We can do [this]!".  What is [this]?  If someone wanted to
go take Wine for a spin, are there any Windows programs out there
you'd recommend they try out?  There's still a ton of Windows apps
with no comparable Linux version, are there any in particular you find
useful that you'd suggest someone try?
</p>

<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
<p>
Photoshop CS2 is clearly the flagship application here, but I think the
message is to try anything they can, that's why we put all that effort
into getting installers to work. At this point there's a good chance
that just about any application will install and at least do something
interesting.

</p>
</quote>
<p>
3a.  Looking ahead, what technical changes do you see Wine needing?
Are there any large patch sets that are already sitting out there that
haven't been merged because of the code freeze?
</p>

<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
<p>
The DIB engine is the major missing feature, I'm hoping to see this in
1.2. Some other interesting patches sitting out there are the iPod
support (and more general USB devices support), and the animated
cursors.
</p><p>
In the longer run, 64-bit support will clearly require some deep
technical changes; it's fortunately not as bad as the 16->32 transition,
but it's still a lot of work.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
3b. We've had a few different groups driving Wine development for a Wine,
namely Google and CodeWeavers.  What do you guys have planned for
areas of focus? Over the years we've seen quite a few large changes that
have moved Wine in very different directions - for example, D3D8
development really ushered in a new era of gaming support for Wine,
the port to OS X has really opened the door on portability, is there
anything like that on the horizon?  Do you ever think someone will have
ntoskrnl loading Windows drivers or hooking into the kernel or something
like that?
</p>

<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
<p>
I don't think Windows drivers are all that interesting for Wine, except
in a few specialized areas like USB devices or printers. General driver
support would really have to go into the Linux kernel to be useful, and
while that's certainly feasible it would be a separate project.
</p><p>
On the Mac OS front we clearly need a quartz graphics driver, it would
make the user experience a lot nicer. Doing it right is a pretty major
task though, so I don't know when it's going to happen.

</p>
</quote>
<p>
4.  What don't we want to do?  What technical things shouldn't we
worry about?  Are there any parts of Windows that aren't worth trying
to support?  For example, Win31 support hangs on tenuously at this
point, is there ever a point where it's not worth supporting?  Or does
Wine fill a valuable role in that it allows legacy applications to be
usable?
</p>

<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
<p>
I think there will come a point where the current Win31 support will
have to be killed; it could be replaced by a cleaner architecture that
is really independent from the 32-bit codebase instead of being
intermingled with it, so that it doesn't get in the way of 32-bit
changes and doesn't get broken all the time. The difficulty will be to
find someone to do the work, working on new features is a lot more
interesting...

</p>
</quote>
<p>
5.  Is Wine too ambitious?  Are we trying to tackle something too big?
Will there ever be a point where the
complexity of the project combined with the regression rate isn't
manageable by the size of our developer community?  At one point about
a decade ago it seemed like Microsoft was releasing new technologies
and new API's every week.  Things seemed to have really slowed down,
but do you think that that trend will continue? Do you think we'll be able
to keep up with future APIs with Vista, Windows 7 etc?
</p>
<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
<p>
So far we have been able to keep up, and I don't expect that to
change. We are of course always lagging a bit behind, but I don't see
the gap increasing, on the contrary. Besides, all the complexity is a
major headache for Microsoft too, they are finding it increasingly
difficult to make significant changes.
</p>
</quote>

<p>
6a.  If you could wave your magic wand and change one thing about
Wine, what would it be?
</p>

<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
<p>
More regression tests...
</p>
</quote>
<p>
6b.  If you could wave your magic wand and change one thing about
Linux [or OS X], what would it be?
</p>

<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
<p>
I'd like to have proper desktop standards, implemented correctly by the
various desktop environments. We are slowly getting there, but it's
taking much longer than it should.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
6c.  If you could wave your magic wand and change one thing about
Windows, what would it be?
</p>

<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
<p>
I wouldn't know where to start, there are so many things that would have
to be fixed...
</p>
</quote>
<p>
7.  Now that Wine has hit 1.0, do you think the major distros will
bundle Wine?  If not, why?  Are they scared of lawsuits?  If so,
should they be?
</p>

<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
<p>
I doubt that they will bundle Wine, since they are all scared of
Microsoft. It's all FUD, there's no rational reason to be afraid, but
even if the likelihood of a lawsuit is very small, the infinite
resources that Microsoft could put into it is enough to discourage them.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
8.  We should ask this only because there's no better way to incite
violence than to start a flamewar on licensing, but do you see any
need to switch to LGPL3?  Most developers seem to be pretty happy with
version 2.  Then again, most people seemed happy with the X11 license
before we rather quickly changed our minds.  Is there anything within
the LGPL3 license that would particularly be a problem for Wine?
</p>

<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
<p>
I don't think there's any problem for Wine either in LGPL2 or LGPL3, so
there's not a lot of motivation for switching. I imagine that the switch
will happen eventually when the need arises to share code with LGPL3
projects.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
9.  With 1.0 out, do you see the need for any process changes?  Will
patches still enter the Wine tree the way they have been?  Do you
think anything will change after 1.0 with regards to development
style?
</p>

<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
<p>
I'm hoping we can make stable releases a bit more frequently than once
every 15 years...
</p><p>
Also we'll hopefully be able to put in place the system for keeping
track of contributions that we've been working on with the SFLC; but
that's mostly a paperwork issue, it won't change fundamentally our way
of working.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
10.  If we could magically add all the developers in the world
and have a Wine 2.0 this time next year, what would you want
to be included?
</p>

<quote who="Alexandre Julliard">
<p>
Some of the obvious major features are the DIB engine, Win64, .NET
support, the quartz driver, etc.  But what really takes time is to track
down and fix all the nasty little incompatibilities that break
applications that would otherwise be quite happy with our existing
feature set. That's where magically adding developers would really help.

Scott Ritchie did some analysis using Ubuntu's popcorn package of Wine usage statistics:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
The Ubuntu "popcon" package is installed when a user opts to share
anonymous usage data during the install process (or within the synaptic
package manager).
</p><p>
Analyzing the data ( <a href="http://popcon.ubuntu.com/">http://popcon.ubuntu.com/</a> ), we can see the following
for Wine:
</p><p>
wine 215262 installed 41731 use regularly 156710 don't use
</p><p>
compare this with dpkg, which every Ubuntu system has:
</p><p>
dpkg 576989 installed 151098 use regularly 411213 don't use
</p><p>
Doing some division, this means that a rather high 37% of Ubuntu users
have Wine installed, and 10% of all Ubuntu users actually make use of
Wine. 7% use Wine "frequently", however popcon defines that.
</p><p>
Combine this with other estimates of Ubuntu's user base (about 8 million
last I heard), and you have approximately 800,000 Wine users.
</p><p>
This data is slightly biased - it doesn't include most Wubi users who
installed Ubuntu from within Windows, since they aren't given any
installation questions.  I believe, though can't prove, that this means
we are under-representing Wine users, as it seems reasonable that Wubi
installs would be more likely to have Windows applications to run and
thus need Wine.
</p><p>
Thanks,
Scott Ritchie
</p>
</quote>
<p>
Scott also takes a gander at some overall usage numbers:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
Indeed.  If Ubuntu still represents the ~30% marketshare it had in 2007
when they did the dekstoplinux.com survey
( <a href="http://www.desktoplinux.com/cgi-bin/survey/survey.cgi?view=archive&amp;id=0813200712407">http://www.desktoplinux.com/cgi-bin/survey/survey.cgi?view=archive&amp;id=0813200712407</a> ),
and if users of other distributions are just as likely to use Wine as
Ubuntu users, then we can estimate there are about 2.6 million Wine
users out there.
</p><p>
Wow!  Of course, this estimate is too high if Ubuntu has grown
substantially in marketshare since the 2007 survey, but even if Ubuntu
has climbed to 40% that's still 2 million Wine users out there.

<p>
Dan Kegel began an interesting thread on how long it takes to compile wine with a comparison to times years ago.  A slew of benchmarks from a number of users followed.
</p>
<quote>
<p>Way back five years ago, we all compared notes on how
long it took to build Wine on our systems.
 <a href="http://www.winehq.org/site/?issue=149#Compile%20Time%20Comparisons%20/%20Tips">http://www.winehq.org/site/?issue=149#Compile%20Time%20Comparisons%20/%20Tips</a>
</p><p>
Today I measured it on a new computer (with a spiffy
new Intel dual core e7200 processor with 2GB of RAM,
 <a href="http://kegel.com/new-computer-2008.html">http://kegel.com/new-computer-2008.html</a> ).
</p><p>
Result: ... it takes me a bit longer today on this machine (11 minutes)
to build as it did then on a dual cpu hot rod (8 minutes).
I guess Moore's Law isn't quite keeping up with Wine's code growth :-)
</p><p>
[Make] Details are on buried that page, but it's "-j3" for the dual core /
dual CPU systems.
</p><p>
I found a nice graph of Wine's codebase size over time:
 <a href="http://www.ohloh.net/projects/wine/analyses/latest">http://www.ohloh.net/projects/wine/analyses/latest</a>
Looks like it's just about exactly doubled since that
last measurement in late 2002.
</p><p>
I suppose my e7200 is a budget performance system; a dual Xeon back then
was pretty special.  Probably have to compare it to something
heftier today?

It's 4m55s on a 2 way dual core Xeon machine (4 cores, 2 Ghz, 4MB cache each).
This is on a hot disk cache, i.e. I ran

This is on Kubuntu 8.04 w/GCC 4.2.3.  The system uses a Q6600
overclocked to 2.9Ghz, 4GB of DDR2 RAM@1066Mhz, and a 9600GT video
card.  I had Amarok and some other stuff going in the background, but
nothing that would make a huge diff.

(1) This one is missing Esd, NAS, Jack and Valgrind (memcheck.h)
support. However in other tests this does not seem to make much
difference. It's also the only one with a different distribution and gcc
version which makes comparisons tricky.
</p><p>
(2) This is actually my main development machine. And damn, it's slow! I
hope to retire it soon but it still hurts. I guess part of the reason
for it being so slow is that it's never really idle. There's always half
a dozen Firefox windows around, gkrellm, xmms, a bunch of background
processes like MythTV, MySQL, software RAID 1, 90% full disks, etc.
</p><p>
(3) This is with 1 job on the Athlon 2600+ and 2 on the Athlon 1800+.
</p><p>
I tried getting Wine 2002 to compile but even in my Debian 3.1 chroot
and with gcc 2.95 it wouldn't. So we don't have a good point of
comparison.

Marcus Meissner took a trip to Linux Tag 2008 and wrote in with his experience.

Hi,
</p><p>
I was at LinuxTag 2008, which is the largest Linux User fair in Germany.
</p><p>
The fair was from Wednesday to Saturday, however I was only there
Saturday. Saturday was openSUSE day and we (openSUSE) had a conference
track over the whole day.
</p><p>
One of those talks in this track was my talk on "Wine - applications
and games on Linux". My talk was well received, the lecture hall was
about 80% full with around 180-200 people.
</p><p>
My german slides are at:<br />
       <a href="http://files.opensuse.org/opensuse/en/0/08/Lt2008-wine.pdf">http://files.opensuse.org/opensuse/en/0/08/Lt2008-wine.pdf</a> <br />
       <a href="http://files.opensuse.org/opensuse/en/6/66/Lt2008-wine.odp">http://files.opensuse.org/opensuse/en/6/66/Lt2008-wine.odp</a> <br />
2 smaller german online journals commented on it, mostly regarding
the 1.0 release part: <br />
       <a href="http://www.golem.de/0806/60100.html">http://www.golem.de/0806/60100.html</a> <br />
       <a href="http://www.oszine.de/node/9141">http://www.oszine.de/node/9141</a> <br />
(There might even be a Video recording later on.)
</p><p>
I received totally unexpected applause on announcing that after 15 years
we finally come to 1.0 release (after over 200 alphas, and 60 betas).
After the talk I had 10 people around me asking questions, and one
specific problem with Adobe InDesign FileOpen Dialog on a laptop
brought to the openSUSE booth.
</p><p>
Interesting Wine related points:
</p><p>
- Kai Tietz of mingw64 told me that they have a GCC patch ready for
 gcc 4.4 which will support the Win64 calling convention attribute
 just like __attribute__(stdcall).
</p><p>
 Was committed to GCC TRUNK:
         <a href="http://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs?view=rev&amp;sortby=date&amp;revision=136311">http://gcc.gnu.org/viewcvs?view=rev&amp;sortby=date&amp;revision=136311</a> <br />
 __attribute__(ms_abi)
</p><p>
 If we have more GCC requirements for Win64, he is willing to help.
</p><p>
 In general he would like to have Wine as a testbed for mingw64
 development (and we could use it as testbed the other way round).
<br />
 <a href="http://mingw-w64.sf.net/">http://mingw-w64.sf.net/</a>

</p><p>
- Avira (Antivirus vendor)
</p><p>
 They use Wine in house to at least get some info on Windows DLLs,
 using version.dll.GetFileVersionInformation.
</p><p>
 While this works for Win32 DLLs, it stopped working/currently does not work
 for Win64 DLLs.

</p><p>
- scan.coverity.com
</p><p>
 Talked to Coverity folks, and also to David Maxell.
 The application will receive an update from Coverity 2.9 to 3.2 in
 the next days/weeks. Not sure if it brings new features.
</p><p>
 Also process issue: We have a large backlog of UNINSPECTED features.
 They suggested that in those cases we could just say "lets not look
 at this old cruft" and mark them somehow "PENDING" or similar. Not
 sure it helps us, but at least we could use "PENDING" for partially
 inspected issues.

</p><p>
- Booth or no Booth
</p><p>
 (We had no booth this year.)
</p><p>
 Since the question will likelay appear again, I thought about whether to
 have a Wine booth itself next year... Well, if we dont have at least 2
 people there over the whole 4 days it does not make sense and finding
 those 2+ people likely is difficult.
</p><p>
 I might be able to spare the time, but this year it was not possible due
 to overlapping schedule. Perhaps its also easier to have a demo-point on
 another larger booth (could ask openSUSE if they would have Wine there).
</p><p>
 At least the Saturday visitors got their knowledge on Wine increased
 by my talk at least.

</p><p>
I got the feeling that people are still quite unsure what works and what
not and expect clear and definitive statements from us.
I pointed to the AppDB several times in those cases and tried not to make
overly positive statements.
</p><p>
People are expectant on 1.0 and I think they are willing to be suprised.
</p><p>
Ciao, Marcus

<topic>Wine 1.0 and Bordeaux</topic>
<p>
As many of you know Steven Edwards has been a member of both the Wine and ReactOS communities for quiet a while now.  He writes in with his thoughts on the Wine 1.0 process most of which are very valid points worth reading.  Towards the end he also mentions a new Free Software company, Bordeaux, that he has begun which combines technologies from Wine, ReactOS, IES4Linux, Winetricks and others.
</p>
<quote>
<p>
Hello All,
I mentioned the other day in the noise about the upcoming 1.0 and the
short comings I felt it had. Others have commented quite a bit on the
subject already and so I'll be pretty brief. I think the 1.0 process
while its been slow has been a good even with its shortcomings. Like
with everything its a learning process and hopefully we will be able
to tweak the process further for 1.x releases.
</p><p>
On the positive side, I think that Dan has done a great job as release
manager, maintaining the bug lists, working on winetest, staying on
top of all the tips and tricks needed to make Valgrind really useful
and maintaining winetricks. I'm also really glad that Alexandre did a
lot of refinement to the winetest infrastructure, everything he has
done with the Wine infrastructure leading up to this point and frankly
for everything he's done for Wine for the past 15 years has been
awesome. Though I will be glad when the freeze is over so we can get
back to having our patches just silently ignored when he does not like
something rather than him having an excuse of the code freeze. =)
</p><p>
One of the shortcomings I see as I stated in my email the other day, I
think we really missed the target on. I think some Office versions
should have been a core requirement of 1.0. Even if it was Office 97
and 2000 working in 98 mode I think we should have been able to
provide a nearly perfect experience out of the box. Or nearly out of
the box as it were, with a little version tweaking. Office is a core
pillar of Microsoft's monopoly and not making this a priority I feel
misses the point of Wine for a lot of users.
</p><p>
Also I think the process can be refined a bit more for subsequent
releases. Some of the developers I spoke with offline were unhappy
about not having a public experimental branch that was blessed to
continue development in. While they could privately do development and
push and pull changes with git, not having a sanctioned experimental
branch, I think slowed the overall processes of development down and
did not really help with bug fixes enough to be warranted. Perhaps in
the future we can maintain parallel lines of development before major
releases. A good example is the Samba guys, they've been working on
Samba 4 for ever, but the stable branch is still being constantly
improved, better, newer stuff is being back ported and development
continues on both tracks.
</p><p>
Finally I am still not really happy with the results of Winetest. I
think we should have had dozens of people that could pass all of the
tests months or even years before 1.0 shipped rather than just
Alexandre's system being the only one that could do a perfect test
run. Maybe we should have just asked him to mirror his setup and
provide a list of every package and configuration option he uses so we
could base target systems on that. Also I think we should have done
something to insure new Wine tests always passed on a fixed version of
Windows a lot sooner. James has done a lot of work to make all of the
tests pass on Windows 2003 but I think we should have done this back
in 2003 and said "every new test has to pass on Windows 2003" as well
as Alexandre's box before it gets merged.
</p><p>
As far as 1.0 goes, its not perfect but its not horrible and I think
we've learned quite a bit and Wine is better now than its ever been. I expect
1.1 or 1.2 whatever number Alexandre wants to call it, will be an
exponential improvement given the experience we've gained.
</p><p>
And lastly I'd like to announce I am starting a new Free Software
company with a long term goal of providing Products and Services
around Wine and ReactOS. The Bordeaux Group has today released
Bordeaux for Linux which builds on the infrastructure laid out in Wine
1.0, Winetricks, IES4Linux and other tools and tries to wrap them all
together in a kind of CrossOver Lite type of environment. The ultimate
goal is to help refine Wine more and aide in ReactOS development to
create a platform that is generic so that users wanting to migrate
away from Windows will have a more broad range of choices, be it Wine
on Linux and the Mac, ReactOS, or even CrossOver,
PlayOnLinux,WineDoors or some other Wine package.
</p><p>
Some of the (limited) work we've already done we hope to be able to
fold back in to Winehq. If your interested check it out

Alexandre Julliard, Wine's maintainer, has posted a brief summary of how future Wine development will work.
</p>
<quote>
<p>
Hi folks,
</p><p>
Again, congrats to everybody for the 1.0 release!
</p><p>
Now that I'm starting to recover from the shock of having actually
shipped 1.0, here are a few notes on future development:
</p><p>
1) Code freeze is over, patches are accepted again. If you sent patches
and they didn't get applied during code freeze, please rebase them
against 1.0 and resend them.
</p><p>
2) Development will continue as usual in the git "master" branch. The
1.1.x development releases will be made from that branch every other
Friday.
</p><p>
3) There is now a git "stable" branch, where only important bug fixes
will be committed. The 1.0.x maintenance releases will be made from that
branch whenever enough changes have accumulated to justify a release.
</p><p>
The process I suggest for the 1.0.1 release is as follows:
</p><p>
- all bugs should be fixed in the master branch first<br />
- once a bug fix has been committed to master, the corresponding bug<br />
 report should be marked fixed, with the sha1 of the commit fixing it
- the bug report should then be put into the 1.0.1 milestone.<br />
</p><p>
This will allow me to periodically query for 1.0.1 bugs that are fixed
in master and cherry-pick the corresponding commits into the stable
branch.
</p><p>
