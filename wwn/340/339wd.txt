OK, I'll see what I can do with the test. Speaking of tests, I submitted test
for zero vertex rhw case (as suggested by H.Verbeet to avoid future
regressions), but I think it didn't get accepted. Perhaps, you can look through
it and provide some feedback? Would be good to hear the bad news now, before I
submit more wrong stuff (esp. considering that I'm also trying to write a test
for another issue with Aliens vs Predator 1 that I want to fix). I'm attaching
the zero rhw test.

I fail to see how you can satisfy new functions by moving it down, not up.

It is likely that Alexandre was waiting for an OK from me or Henri. He is the 
only committer, but when someone he doesn't know sends a patch he usually 
waits for the OK from someone who is maintaining the part of Wine. I think I 
forgot to send an OK mail to the test when you submitted it.

A few minor suggestions for the test:
* The vertex structure should be declared somewhere else already, as part of 
the lighting test I think. You can reuse that instead of redeclaring it.

* You don't have to AND the color if 0xffffff, getPixelColor should do that 
already.

* You don't have to set the render states unless you need a different setting 
than the previous tests leave behind

* The "if(hr == D3D_OK)" after BeginScene should be changed 
to "if(SUCCEEDED(hr))"

If you know how to configure bugzilla to prevent the bug creator
from reopening it, I'd like to hear about it (AFAIK it's not
possible). As far as I remember regular users who are not the
creator are already disallowed from changing the resolution.

OK, thanks a lot. Regarding vertex structure - I'm afraid I can't reuse struct
vertex/nvertex, because I need a very specific format for this test
(D3DFVF_XYZRHW | D3DFVF_DIFFUSE). I could probably reuse sVertexT from fogtest,
but then I'll also have to set specular, that I don't really need. I looks
easier to declare a custom format that has just what I need.

I'll make changes according to other suggestions.

I've ran into some issues while trying to write a test for the old D3D
TEXTUREMAPBLEND state AVP1 game uses. I hope you can help me a bit with it.

The problem is, interfaces at least as recent as DX7 seem to be refusing this
state (I can't make it work on XP). So I probably have to use something older.
Unfortunately, so far I had no luck in creating interfaces that are older than
IDirect3DDevice7, but less painful to use than the very first IDirect3DDevice: I
don't have any DX6 docs and all working examples I can find including AVP1 use
either IDirect3DDevice or something from DX7 or later, and trivial modifications
to examples with IDirect3DDevice I've made fail on XP, usually on the step when
I create IDirect3DDevice3 or something like that. So grudgingly I settled for
IDirect3DDevice and I even have an almost complete test. But it's longer that it
could be with DrawPrimitive calls, because of all that executebuffer horror.
So the question is, is it ok if I submit it like this? From a certain point of
view, there can even be benefits from using IDirect3DDevice, as it may also test
some functions and codepaths not covered by other tests. Or do I have to
continue to look for ways to write it with newer interfaces so that to make it
more compact by getting rid of executebuffer? And, also, where to put it?
ddraw/tests/visual.c seems mostly IDirect3DDevice7-centric, so, perhaps, visual
tests involving earlier interfaces should go in a separate file? Or put it into
visual.c and simply ignore / release DX7 interfaces?

We could add flags for "needs more information" and perhaps one
for "reproducible bug report with enough initial information".

(A flag is something that can be requested to be set and can then
be granted or denied by someone who was given the required rights.)

Our bugzilla is in git, patches are welcome.

I think a small and easy explanation on the new-bug form, that
refers one to a wiki page for the full guide is a good thing.

(I guess it's probably hard to filter bad bug reports
automatically and even harder to not inconvenience our good bug
reporters at the same time.)

Ah, that's ok then. I forgot that the other vertex has a specular color, so a 
new vertex type is fine.

Yeah, IDirect3DDevice(1) and IDirect3DExecuteBuffer are a royal pain in the 
ass. Here's some popular rant about it to ease your pain:

http://www.exaflop.org/docs/d3dogl/d3dogl_jc_plan.html

I think that a test using execute buffers is a great thing. This interface is 
terribly obscured and we have only one small test for it. You can add it to 
visual.c if you want, or a new file(maybe executebuffer.c, or something), I 
think both places are ok.

You can also try to QueryInterface old IDirect3DDevice* versions from 
IDirect3DDevice7, but I think this doesn't work as the COM theory says on 
Windows. I haven't yet tested the restrictions and implemented them because I 
haven't seen a game yet that depends on them.

I think I will be able to do the changes next weekend.

If no one objects until Friday, I'll assume that everyone is fine
with the changes as proposed in this thread.

I'll furthermore assume that I can modify the descriptions of
categories as I see fit (I explained in a previous mail on this
topic on how those could be made to convey more exactly which
parts of wine they cover).

I just saw that there still are overlaping categories in at least
one case, but that can be fixed in another step.

I didn't see anything obviously wrong with the test, except perhaps
checking hr against D3D_OK, but ddraw is more your area.

I don't think it's a bad thing to do though... it's pretty useful the
be able to comment out the other tests without breaking the current
test, especially when writing new tests. In general, we might want to
consider using a new device for each test to prevent states from one
test interfering with those from another test.

Yes, I think it doesn't run on Windows, IIRC that was the first thing I tried.
At least this is so for XP, which itself is partly broken in DX6 and less
support though, from what I see (e.g. AVP1 3D engine is broken).

Just one more question - I'm looking into this hr==D3D_OK vs SUCCEEDED(hr) thing
and there appears to be some problems with consistency. In ddraw/tests/visual.c
I see both hr==D3D_OK and SUCCEEDED, in one place even result of BeginScene are
checked as hr==D3D_OK, so it's somewhat confusing. How do I tell, generally,
what to use for ok(), if() etc, hr==D3D_OK or SUCCEDED? Do all checks ultimately
need to be turned into SUCCEEDED or it's just that some of the calls have been
found to return undocumented values other than D3D_OK, but are no errors?

Maybe on the page for registering a bugzilla and/or on first login?

A resolution is much better.  Using a flag of needsmoreinfo usually does

I like the recommendation that a page be read before submitting bugs. 
There are a growing number of duplicates (I'm responsible for at least
one of them and I've been at the bug business for a long time) and
incomplete reports points to the need for a readme type of page.  The
regulars should not be subject to reading the page (this could be a
cookie function that just counts the number of bugs submitted and should
be a very simple cookie as far as name and function.)

+1 to this.  Automatic filtering can lead to some necessary reports
being skipped or deleted when additional, useful information will make
them usable.

Thank you for taking time to read through my suggestions as well.

One last comment, the OpenOffice.org project (I think) stopped the
ability for anyone without the canconfirm permission to reopen a bug.  I
might want to look at this in the future if time allows.

Unless you actually want to test the exact return value, you should
use SUCCEEDED / FAILED. Some of the tests do get this wrong,
unfortunately.

I usually test against the exact return value(D3D_OK) in the ok() statements, 
and SUCCEEDED / FAILED when deciding the codepath the test takes(e.g. 
if(SUCCEEDED(BeginScene())) )

 Hi,

 I think you are right: the interface seems to be queried from dmime,
although I can't confirm it since I can't make the debugger stop in my
function to see the backtrace... and I can't see the assembly code that
called my function.

 I've tried to use the builtin dmime but it doesn't make a sound altough it
seems to call DSound functions frequently with code executed in a timer.
It's probably because IDirectMusicPerformance8Impl_PlaySegmentEx is not
implemented. I've tried to add some code to make it work but since I don't
really know how it works, my small hack doesn't play a sound!

 So now I'm stuck. Thanks anyway for your help.

 Guillaume

There is no need to add one more reason for a bug resolution IMHO,

Both the two <0 checks and the abs() invocations are needless since
DWORDS are positive by definition.

(I did not get _any_ response for my first mail a month ago and I still

Hi,

Problem occurs when Depth Of Filed is turned on in Tomb Raider Anniversary.

I simply overwrote the 0.9.52 wined3d.dll.so file with the 0.9.44 wined3d.dll.so in /usr/lib/wine, it works, but a little bit slower.

See attachment!

Regards,

Laszlo

Going by the commit message, I assume this test would currently fail?
You can't do that. You either have to send the patches that fix the
problem first, or you have to wrap the failing tests in todo_wine
blocks, and remove the todo_wine blocks in the patch that fixes the
tests they wrap.

INVALID seems harsh, it may scare away novice reporters.

Do we want to make it easy to search for bugs stuck
in a needmoreinfo kind of state?  If so, a keyword or state
might be handy.

Does anybody remember good old gnu gnats, the old bug
tracking system?  It was great this way; it had an explicit
notion of whose ball the court was in.  I miss that.

As far as I've seen NEEDMOREINFO used in bugzilla, it is on the same level as 
NEW, ACCEPTED and FIXED. So new bugs come in as new, and someone looks at 
them and accepts the bug if the information is complete enough to work on the 
bug, and sets it to FIXED INVALID or NEEDMOREINFO if it's invalid or doesn't 
have enough information to reproduce it.

So far I've always left a bug on NEW until I could reproduce it, NEEDMOREINFO 
would be more clear, but I don't feel very strong about this either way.

Cheers,
Kai

I don't see a lower cased "no" in dlls/kernel32/nls/nor.nls. Where did you
notice that? Wine has the same data as for instance my XP SP2 reports:
LOCALE_SISO3166CTRYNAME "NO"

I did see them in the git tree. The files include "LANGUAGE
LANG_NORWEGIAN, SUBLANG_NORWEGIAN_BOKMAL" (which is correct) but what
happens when Norwegian Nynorsk (no_NN) is added? The filenames should be
changed according to ISO 639-1. But I could be wrong.

Examples:
./programs/wordpad/No.rc
./programs/winemine/No.rc
./programs/winecfg/No.rc
./programs/winhelp/No.rc

In the else statement InExt could be 0 (either that or OutExt would be 0)
which would cause a division by 0 exception. Definitely doesn't sound right
to me. But I have no idea what that code is supposed to do.

Appart of this issue I recommend to move the D3D1 creation into a separate 
function. Eventually more D3D1 tests will be written, and we want to 
discourage copypasting that huge block of code.

I am not sure about this. From my understanding of color keying, the color 
keying should only depend on the texture, not the diffuse color. 
Unfortunately, this is mutually exclusive with always honoring the app's 
blending settings. I have two games which use color keying, Moto Racer 2 and 
Prince of Persia 3D. I'll test the patches with those two games.

The problem is that our color keying is emulated, so we'll always have to 
fiddle to get it working properly everywhere. The correct, but complex and 
incomplete fix would be a replacement shader for the fixed function pipeline 
which can implement color keying properly using 'KIL' or 'discard'. 
Unfortunately that won't fix the problem for cards without fragment shader 
support.

The other patches look good to me

There's no reason to use a separate file for every variant. Both
Norwegian locales should go into the same No.rc file.

That's not the way it's done in the SDK.

I don't think we want to duplicate all that code. The Ascii functions
should convert their arguments and call the Unicode ones.

This doesn't look like a pixel shader problem, more like a blitting or 
offscreen rendering problem. Can you run a regression test and file a bug?

I tested pop3d and Moto Racer 2. Pop3d still works as expected, but moto racer 
2 has some missing geometry. It draws some opaque parts of the scene with 
color keying on, and a diffuse alpha of 0.0, so the alpha test kicks in and 
the geometry is missing.

The moto racer 2 demo is available online, e.g. 
http://downloads.gamezone.com/demos/d1576.htm. Note that the installer 
refuses to run, unless you set your X server's depth to 16. I also caused a 
regression in that game when I fixed some bugs with native d3drm.dll, so you 
need the attached hack.
(I didn't have time and energy to write a test to test that, but I think that 
BRANCHFORWARD tokens with offset 0 are special, and that the existing 
executebuffer test in d3d.c just points out the special case, but the common 
case is implemented incorrectly)

You've got it reversed. The proper locale setting is nn_NO.

The Nynorsk is in non.nls.

Oh now I see this case I haven't thought about. For some reason, or maybe no
reason at all, Moto racer sets alphaop to selectarg1 and alphaarg1 to current
(diffuse)! That looks kind of strange (if it then gives vertices with diffuse
alpha = 0), but maybe it's just "optimizing" by setting states it will need
later. And it expects it to work despite diffuse alpha is 0 because it disables
alpha blending and alpha test. In wine though the latter state is overriden by
colorkey emulation so the result is bad. But I think this can be sorted out by
checking ALPHABLENDENABLE, because it's probably a reasonable indicator for
telling whether the app is going to give something meaningful in diffuse alpha
or not. Do you think something along the lines of attached patch can be an
acceptable solution? With it, AVP1 game works properly and it also seems to
bring back geometry in moto racer, at least as far as I can tell.

IIRC, the Mono gdiplus isn't so useful for us because it doesn't
deal with GDI handles the way we need.
That's one reason we have our own gdiplus now.
It might be more useful if you would look at fixing bugs
in our gdiplus rather than trying to wrap Mono's.

I think these two casts should stay as LPWSTR is compatible with WORD * 
only by coincidence - one is intended to hold characters and the other 
numbers.

Not that I know of.  But I don't think that's a problem.

I think a more interesting question is, when are we going to
buckle down and implement a DIB engine?

Subject: TrackPopupMenu() and TPM_RECURSE 
Message-ID: <51450.80.216.209.132.1199319146.squirrel@webmail01.one.com>

Hi,

According to the MSDN documentation (see below), TrackPopupMenu() should
only display multiple popupmenus if TPM_RECURSE is used. At the moment,
Wine always seems to allow this and in some applications this results in
very confusing menu overlaps.

Moreover, the old popup menus will never be closed. This seems to
particularly be the case in applications that use TrackPopupMenuEx() for
their application menus.

I was looking at the code and was unsure of how existing popup menus in a
window should be safely closed when the application calls TrackPopupMenu()
a second or third time. Does anyone have a suggestion?

Best regards,

Nicholai



Windows 98/Me, Windows 2000/XP: Use the TPM_RECURSE flag to display a menu
when another menu is already displayed. This is intended to support
context menus within a menu.

Maybe use cairo there... an advanced GDI-like "DIB engine" is part of it.

It probably isn't pixel-for-pixel identical to the Windows GDI.

Subject: Can't figure out how tolink a program
Message-ID: <477CB0EE.2040309@mcbride.name>


I have a library built under Linux with Wine (mylib.a) that uses various 
Windows API (mainly GUI) that built fine.  I compiled the main program 
from .c to .o and from .rc to .res just fine.  My problem is I can't 
figure our what command line to use to link:

    myprogram.o
    myprogram.res
    mylib.a

In other words, when I try to link it all together I get a bunch of 
unresolved externals on things like:

    ReleaseDC
    GetDC
    SendMessageA
    MulDiv
    GlobalAlloc
    etc.......

I don't know what gcc command line argument to load the normal API's.

I checked all the online docs.  There are no examples and the docs that 
do exist state that hey are out-of-date.

I would really appreciate a few simple example command lines to link a 
program with the normal API's AND my .res file.

Thank you.

Are there any plans to use cairo in the Wine gdiplus implementation
like mono does? Or would that need a winecairo.drv?

Hi all,

I am new in this list, so... Hello!!!

Well, I work in a CERT and we are create a automatic malware detection tool with
wine.

On the first part the project we use the debug log to monitorize the file
access, registry...

I want know where can i find the option to WINEDEBUG.

In this time, we are used trace+file, trace+reg.

Can trace the sockets??

Kind regards

PD: Sorry for my english, :P

gdiplus is just a wrapper (mostly) around gdi32 APIs. IMHO spreding
around ideas about introducing a Wine dependency on cairo missing
the point of its usefulness.

You shouldn't access the object after having released it.

When I need to figure out WINEDEBUG flags, I always use grep, e.g.

dank at lappy:~/wine-git/dlls$ grep DEFAULT_DEBUG ws*/*.c
ws2_32/async.c:WINE_DEFAULT_DEBUG_CHANNEL(winsock);
ws2_32/protocol.c:WINE_DEFAULT_DEBUG_CHANNEL(winsock);
ws2_32/socket16.c:WINE_DEFAULT_DEBUG_CHANNEL(winsock);
ws2_32/socket.c:WINE_DEFAULT_DEBUG_CHANNEL(winsock);
wsock32/service.c:WINE_DEFAULT_DEBUG_CHANNEL(winsock);
wsock32/socket.c:WINE_DEFAULT_DEBUG_CHANNEL(winsock);

So yes, try +winsock.

So how well is Wine running the malware you're interested in?

I am probably too late, but a way to get exact amount of memory of active

Yes, I think this idea is quite nice. It makes a bit of a hacky impression, 
but the color keying emulation is a hack after all. Only one small 
suggestion, I think you don't have to call tex_alphaop unconditionally in 
state_blend, I think this is only needed if COLORKEYENABLE is on.

On a sidenode, somewhere I've seen a document stating that the Nvidia Windows 
driver emulates color keying with the alpha test as well:

http://developer.nvidia.com/object/ColorKey_in_D3D.html

It implements the alpha setting in a slightly different way, and I am not sure 
if we can emulate that without a fragment shader. Still it's an interesting 
read.

  Hi,
Is there something wrong with these couple of patches?

http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-patches/2007-December/048436.html
kernel32/console: convert newborn wineserver handle to kernel32 console 
handle.
This patch makes screenbuffer handle, returned by CreateConsoleScreenBuffer 
function, be a really "console" handle (h&3 == 3). Fixes behaviour of 
WriteFile function called upon this handle.

and

http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-patches/2007-December/048291.html
tools/wineshelllink: do not execute applications directly, use 'start' utility 
instead
This patch allows to create correct desktop/menu shortcuts for console 
applications (e.g. Far Manager).
I've caught on the idea suggested by Vitaliy (If console needs to be created 
for those apps and there isn't one, then Wine should do it when starting an 
app.), but I cannot understand how to check it - dumb console always present 
(even redirected to /dev/null):
http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2007-December/061399.html

If I missed something important just let me know.

So, we only try a few malware, [ 3 files ], but all ran correctly.
Two files was compiled in VisualC, and the last one in VisualBasic. We was

Subject: xrandx responds with too many modes.
Message-ID: <1199407765.4321.21.camel@dhcppc4>

The xrandx X11 extension is very handy.
Using it for wine makes great sense.

But... the extension also enumerates a whopping amount of modes.
Each resolution has a multitude of frequencies and bit-depth variants.

Some applications are simply not prepared for that magnitude of
information when they call EnumDisplaySettings() (user32) or
EnumDisplayModes (ddraw).

When using "normal" windows, only a few modes are returned.

I know its not a bug, as it could happen on Windows if someone published
a driver which implemented tons of silly and crooked modes.

Would it be acceptable to insert a filter in xrandx.c (X11-drv),
which only allowed "normal" windows resolutions to be enumerated?
Does anyone need those awkward ones? 

The filter would look allot like the one in desktop.c (X11-drv) which is
currently used by the desktop mode.

I already fixed a portion of the bugs caused by this, as there was a 
natural limitation which should be set by EnumDisplayModes() which was
not honored. I sent in patch for this already. So at least now we can
play the classic "Grand Theft Auto"....

Thanks,

/p

Subject: USER32 - SPI_GETMOUSE missing a default value.
Message-ID: <1199417956.4321.30.camel@dhcppc4>

I have an app which is bailing out because it cannot get valid data
from SPI_GETMOUSE - and indeed this reg key does not exist.

The key should be in "Control Panel\\Colors" under CURRENT_USER.

There are similar values in the "Control Panel" folder in the registry.

Is there a reason this value is not initialized ?

If i want to fix it, then:

1) Where is the best place to initialize values like these? I presume
its during boot, where the mouse values should be read?

2) Should i get the mouse data from X11 or just simulate something?

An application that I'm using contains a internal web browser based off the

Loading a webpage from a web server works as expected, but when I try to use 
the
"file://C:\myTestPage.html" syntax the file fails to load.

NOTE: myTestPage.html has a single paragraph with one line of text

Are local files supported in the web browser?
Do I need to call a function besides Naviagate2() to load the file?

That's a wrong key name.

SPI_GETMOUSE should work just fine, do you have a sample code which
doesn't work? Is the app trying to read the registry directly without
using SystemParametersInfo?

Is this with a specific X driver? The binary nvidia driver only lists
modes explicitly declared in xorg.conf.

That isn't the clearest message. It should probably say it didn't set
lpSurface to NULL.

It's not a good idea to include Unix headers after the Windows ones,
that can create trouble.

I have to admit I'm not a big fan of that sort of one include to rule
them all approach, I think it's better to have each file maintain
control over what it includes and in which order. The global
mshtml_private.h header should only include the stuff it itself depends
on, not every single header that any source file may want to use.

Subject: d3dx implementation senseless?
Message-ID: <E1JAlwM-0008Kq-96@www13.emo.freenet-rz.de>

Hi,
I enjoyed the current wine development of the D3DX libraries and also tried to implement an interface.
However, while testing it I noticed that Wine seems to fully support everything when it has a native
d3dx9.dll (though it even was able to run one of my games without any dll...). So I was asking myself
if there's even a reason to implement anything other than the inlined functions of D3DX, when we only
lose performance and development time with it. Also, what would we do at functions like
D3DXCreateTextureFromFile which supports 9 file formats? Would we implement e.g. a BMP file
loader ourselves or would we use a 3rd party library for that? Are there any patents regarding the
DX specific file formats (.x/.dds)? Don't misunderstand me, I'd also like to help out at D3DX, but I
really think we'd be better off by removing everything of D3DX but the inlined stuff.
    Best regards,
        Tony Wasserka


(PS: if one argues that we need the implementation for WineLib, I _think_ it'd be enough to just
stub all functions so that the program compiles fine and then use the native dll again)

Well, does the d3dx* DLL license permit redistribution and use with 
Wine?

I pretty much doubt so.

So this alone would be a reason to implement them.

Huh? I don't declare any mode in the xorg.conf and i'm using the nvidia
binary driver. The drivers can figure out nowadays what works or
doesn't. I get 9 modes back but i have a max resolution of only 1280x1024.

It doesn't here (?). Furthermore in French ":" should be preceded by an
unbreakable space (like it's the case now) and not a normal space.

Just out of curiosity, what do you use this for?
Whats wrong with the 640 x 480? Why do you need the extra 640x32 pixels?

Another way of fixing the problem could be to limit the amount
of frequency variants. Not sure if wine can use them for anything 
useful anyway. Could we report all modes at just 60Hz, or
would that be too naughty? 

This is actually what is done for the desktop implementation, so it
might work. This would also be easy to change in xrandx.c as the 
frequencies are handled separately.

I do not think patents which are blocking your ability to use the DLLs
in Wine. It is your Windows license.

I believe that if you have a Windows license for your machine, you are
free to use Windows or its DLLs. This includes all the "free" downloads
from their web-pages. I think, if you do not have a license for that
machine, you are in violation of the license, which is illegal.

I am not sure i got all the details right but you can probably find more
on their web-page.

If i understand it correctly, it of course means that there are no
really free downloads on their web-page, as they all rely on a purchase
of Windows. This makes the "free" download kind of expensive. 

For Wine it means that anything the user has to D/L from their homepage
is a no-no.

I'd say "'coz" is not a typo, but was written that way intentionally to

the standard spelling. As such it should not be modified.

640x480 does not integer-scale to my 1280x1024 display.  With 640x512
I have perfect pixel alignment (2x zoom), no blurriness from the
scaling.  I'll take 640x512 over 800x600 even because of the graphical
nicety of it, and there are plenty of games (with options turned all
the way up) that I cannot run at a good framerate at 1024 or 1280.

The application is the game "World In Conflict".
The application is reading correctly through SystemParametersInfo().

The problem as i see it, is that there is no default value for the mouse
parameters in the registry. You can see this by doing a clean wine
install, and checking the registry. I think this value should have a
default which should be set every time the DLL is loaded, so
applications can read the value via SystemParametersInfo().
Alternatively, the DLL could detect the missing info at runtime, but
that would not handle the case where the app tries to read the key
directly, so i still think the first version is the best.

Oh well, I didn't think about that, sorry.
Then it of course is a good thing if we implement our own d3dx.

I've seen too many people who aren't
even aware of the difference between slang and standard
english.   So (without looking back at who committed it)
I'm tempted to correct that kind of thing, just because

I changed that in two places. The first one had another typo in the
same file, so I went ahead and fixed both typos. The second occurrence
was in a separate file, but I corrected it for consistency.

Translating his question:
I'm looking for a DIB driver which will let me run the program "PSDWin"

Donnette,

Le plupart de personne qui travaille avec WINE parlent seulement
anglais au cette listserv.  A respondre de ta question,
malheureusement, cette driver n'exist pas maintenant.  Possible au
future.  C'est un piece du wine tres difficile.

"Most people who work with wine speak only english in this listserv.
However to respond to your question, unfortunately there isn't a DIB
driver yet.  Its a very hard part of wine to write."

The directx license as far as I understand it, allows installing and using the 
dx runtime, which d3dx* is a part of, on Wine, even if the user does not have 
a Windows license. However, it does not allow shipping the DLLs with any 
application that it intended to run on non-windows platforms. So we need the 
d3dx DLLs if anyone wants to port an app that uses them using Wine.

Appart of that, there's a usability argument. Since Windows XP SP2 and Windows 
Vista ship many of those DLLs, apps forget to ship them. Even if apps ship 
the dx runtime, there are some tricks needed to install it. Just having the 
DLLs available helps the usability of Wine.

just fyi, at least the .dds file format is well documented. I don't know 
about .x, but I think it is just plain text as well. Applications like 
kuickshow(the kde image viewer) have an implementation for it, and I think 
Gimp supports it as well. DXTn makes problems, especially writing DXTn 
images, but we can maybe use the Nvidia texture tools(MIT license) to solve 
both technical and legal problems.

Now that i think of it, Marcus's point about redistribution is even
more relevant than the problem with licensing.

If one was was allowed (legally) to copy DLLs from Windows without a
license, i could do it..... because i know how.... could my mother?....
no way!

The only people that i have any success in convincing to switch
to Linux/Wine were in situations where it worked "out of the box".

Having to download tons of redistributeables and DLLs from the web
is not a good solution for "non technical users". Even on real Windows
this is a problem.

I cannot count the many times family & friends have
called me saying: "Help! it says... Unable to find blabla.dll or blabla
not installed" (using 2K/XP/Vista). Lets not copy this scenario. I want
them to stop calling :-).

Ah... yes of course. Damn those flat-panel screens :-)

I have a similar monitor in 1280x1024 but only use 640x480 for games,
where i don't notice the problem.

Point taken. Scrap that idea!

But what about sacking the variants with different frequencies?
Would anyone have a problem with that idea? As mentioned, i doubt
if Wine users can use the frequency adjustment for anything useful
anyway? But then again i might have missed something again.

seem to point to Jacek's set of changes.  Both can be seen here:

Bugzilla has some nice "Change Over Time" graphs.
These show there's been a nice chunk of bugs
moved into 'Fixed' state in the last week:

http://bugs.winehq.org/reports.cgi?product=Wine&datasets=NEW%3A&datasets=UNCONFIRMED%3A&datasets=CLOSED%3A&datasets=FIXED%3A

BTW somebody should give Jeff Zaroyko bugzilla
privs, he's doing a nice job, and should be able
to mark bugs fixed.

SystemParametersInfo should already handle the case of missing settings
in the registry providing default values. Unless you have an application
which reads registry directly, so that's not a hypothetical case there is
no need to fix it. Again, do you have a code snippet or a piece of relay
log showing a failure?

Subject: Gates of Skeldal - d3d problem ?
Message-ID: <20080105214411.GA19053@tangens.sinus.cz>

Hi!
  A classic Czech RPG game, Gates of Skeldal, has been released for free
download.
  I've tried the game for my children, but it seems to have a problem in wine.
  Installation is perfect. Running the game basically works, intro video plays
well, but then the problem occurs. Starting the game causes that every mouse
move or other activity quickly swaps forth and back the correct window contents
with a previous one, which should not be displayed anymore (like the in-game
window and  main menu window). Not all the window is always swapped, sometimes
just some areas flash forth/back. To be even worse, the mouse pointer is not
properly erased, so the window begins filled with its traces. After a while,
the window is totally garbled and playing is impossible.

Synchronously with this problem, the wine console starts to be flooded with
the following message:

fixme:d3d:IWineD3DSwapChainImpl_Present Unhandled present options 0x33fd58/0x33fd48
fixme:d3d:IWineD3DSwapChainImpl_Present Unhandled present options 0x33fd38/0x33fd28

fixme:d3d:IWineD3DSwapChainImpl_Present Unhandled present options 0x33fd38/0x33fd28

Is it possible that this fixme refers to the real cause or the problem, or
are these messages just harmless, not related to the problem ?

Tested on a today's git.
The game can be freely downloaded (cca 188 MB) there (it is in Czech, but the
menu is easy and anybody can find how to control the game):

This is useless. Most bugs marked invalid are not Wine bugs. Only few are 
those that reporters did not include enough information.

Yes that. If we have only one bugzilla admin and we can not get any response 
from that admin for the 4!!! weeks - REGARDLESS what the reasons are, we 
need more admins period.

Sorry, but I expect more people to be involved and having appropriate 
access. Also if some key person decides to take a vacation, then he/she 
better notify the list.

In case of these component changes I felt that there was too much
controversy (and no final proposal where the only response was
"yes"; this paired with that some bugzilla admins wanted me to
have an -devel approved list of changes) for me to do changes to
bugzilla before waiting some more. (Though some delay can
probably be attributed to the fact that I am currently without
Internet on weekdays, outside of work.) Anyway no part of that
was in any way urgent.

I feel honored to be titled a key person of the Wine project, but
contrary to some belief I'm not the only bugzilla admin. Dan
Kegel ( who according to a recent mail from himself might be
unaware of his permissions ;) ), Jeremy Newman and Tony Lambregts are
also bugzilla admins.

If anyone would like to do things that need bugzilla admin
permissions, one can post a reasonable request for those
permissions to -devel.

Usually one can get changes made to bugzilla that need admin by
posting an _exact_ and detailed request to -devel and achieve
general agreement. ( And I'll also probably stop ignoring
component requests :) when the current component changes are
done. )

That being said, I do think that we don't need more bugzilla
admins, there is just not that much work to be done that really
needs those permissions.

I disagree.  We need to have a method to let the reporter know that the 
project needs more information in order to properly troubleshoot a 
problem.  Closing a reported bug as INVALID is not applicable in this 
case.  If the bug is outside of the scope of the project, it should be 
marked as such.  The word invalid to me means that the bug could not be 
reproduced or the information provided did not disclose a solvable 
problem OR the bug has already been fixed and that the fix will be in 
the next release.  It may be necessary to add a resolution of 
NOTINPROJECT to handle those problems that are outside the scope of the 
project. 

Just my .02 dollars.

Yes if it's used without waiting for an answer (or even even more
without requesting further clarification) it might make one feel
shot down. And usually it's used too quickly. Most bug
resolutions should probably be only done when some care or
communication was done to check that it's the correct resolution,
to avoid resolution ping-pong.

I think a keyword would be appropriate. It would nicely fit with
the "Abandoned?" keyword: first add needmoreinfo, if no answer
for 6 month add "Abandoned?", after further 6 month resolve
abandoned.

What controversy?  The final list proposed by me and Vitaliy was unchallenged.

12 months to close a bug as abandoned?  6 months is already too long
for abandoned.  The policy has always been: if a reporter does not
respond to an information request within X months, close the bug as
abandoned.  We have 3843 bugs for Wine and the list is only getting
larger.  This fear of closing bugs is only making the problem worse.
People seem to forget that a user can always come back and reopen the
bug report.

We do have a method: asking for information in a comment.  Why would
you close a bug as invalid if it's fixed in the next release?
NOTINPROJECT?  Invalid.  Why make this even more complicated than it
already is.  Just say in a comment that the bug lies with another
project and close it as invalid.  In this case, invalid means 'not a
Wine bug.'

Message-ID: <100822.54440.qm@web26005.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Since everybody agrees that we need a built-in d3dx9, we could begin to implement it.
In the last talk about it, no plan was found to implement it: does one create a wined3dx or implement on the top of the last d3dx9 dll?

So, I think that a definitive answer should be given very quickly.

I think you should be aware that Wine is no replacement for a security 
tool. If you run a malware using Wine, it is possible for this malware 
to interact directly with your Linux machine, bypassing your protection.

With controversy I was refering to the discussion before. Btw.
the last mail on that thread is now only 2 weeks old and was not
even one week old when Vitaliy sent the first mail in this
thread.

Anyone who wants to to do stuff is welcome, just speak up.

Afaik only selected users can reopen bugs. Users that can edit
bugs and the reporter can do that and if I remember correctly we
seem to want to also prevent the reporter from doing that.

Open bugs lingering in needmoreinfo or "Abandoned?" don't hurt.
Othoh closing bugs too quickly as invalid or abandoned may drive
bug reporters away which would hurt us in the long run.

If you'd just want to get less bugs we could have a special
permission for filing bugs and only let selected people who we
trust to report really useful bugs (though I think that is not
what we want).

Anyway the 12 month were only an example, I'm fine with 6 month.
I'm more concerned about closing bugs (e.g. as invalid) where
someone is active and disagrees.

It might make sense to rename "Abandoned?" to needmoreinfo, so
that one can key a bug as needmoreinfo and after x month with
that keyword and no response resolve it abandoned.

Though we probably don't want to use needmoreinfo on bugs where
it's possible for someone to retest if the bug is still there
(e.g. where there is a download for the application and the bug
is described sufficiently to check for it oneself).

I updated that wiki page a little, and added my and newman's photos of
wineconf, and the big group photo. Does anyone else have a photo album
they want to share? I created mine with picasa for linux, which uses wine.

Would it be better to have separate A/W painting functions?

Please don't apply this yet, it needs further research.
The valgrind manual tells us in the Client Requests section
that VALGRIND_MAKE_xxx functions return such a block handle [1],
But looking at the implementation of valgrind/adding traces to valgind DISCARD request
show it returns 0xffffffff ?

Greetings Peter

[1] valgrind manual Release 3.3.0 - 4.6. Client Requests
* VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_NOACCESS, VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_UNDEFINED and VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_DE
  These mark address ranges as completely inaccessible, accessible but containing unde?ned data, and accessible
  and containing de?ned data, respectively. Subsequent errors may have their faulting addresses described in terms
  of these blocks. _Returns a "block handle"_. Returns zero when not run on Valgrind.
* VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_DEFINED_IF_ADDRESSABLE. This is just like VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_DEFINED
  but only affects those bytes that are already addressable.
* VALGRIND_DISCARD: At some point you may want Valgrind to stop reporting errors in terms of the blocks
  de?ned by the previous three macros. To do this, the above macros return a small-integer "block handle". You
  can pass this block handle to VALGRIND_DISCARD. After doing so, Valgrind will no longer be able to relate
  addressing errors to the user-de?ned block associated with the handle. The permissions settings associated with
  the handle remain in place; this just affects how errors are reported, not whether they are reported. Returns 1 for
  an invalid handle and 0 for a valid handle (although passing invalid handles is harmless). Always returns 0 when
  not run on Valgrind.

Message-ID: <a71bd89a0801060836h4b5d5fcbj8ed3b3f32fb1155a@mail.gmail.com>

I've been seeing the error

shell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access
parent directories: No such file or directory

a lot recently when running Wine, probably when installers
finish.   It started a couple weeks ago.
I think it's a bash error message.
Anyone else seeing that, or know what causes it?
(Do we run our wrapper script in a directory that goes away, say?)

Subject: bugzilla component and keyword cleanup
Message-ID: <20080106165555.GA4687@crissy.swd.zerebecki.de>

I'm done with one step of the changes.

See the following URLs for how things currently look:
http://bugs.winehq.org/describekeywords.cgi
http://bugs.winehq.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Wine

Improvement suggestions are welcome.

Does anyone know how the CVS/GIT version is marked so that it
gets selected on the new bug page and if that is also possible
for the component?


Now for further improvements:

Changes which IMHO should not be done:
wine-help -> hhctrl - Help viewer implementation
    help is currently not for the various help APIs but for user
    that want help. We should obsolete this component. We can
    create a new component for the help APIs if there is demand.
(new) -> vdm - Wine 16-bit compatibility layer
(new) -> win16 - Wine 16-bit compatibility layer
    vdm is part of the component dos, right?
    A win16 keyword is probably useful as win16 support is
    intertwined in quite some other DLLs and thus components.

Components that are marked as obsolete now, but where it's not
sure how to replace them:
multimedia
    Should we really replace this? Replace it with what? An mci and winmm component?
console
    I didn't really made my mind up about this one yet...
files
ipc
ports
winelib
    Possibly replace each with a keyword, see below.

Changes to the keywords:
    conformance (delete)
        Delete this keyword, because it fits probably most wine bugs.
    testcase (new)
        Bugs that have a testcase attached, in source form but
        not necessarily integrated into the Wine test suite.
    win16 (new)
        Bugs in the win16 parts of Wine.
    dotnet (new)
        Bugs that appear in applications using dotNet and that
        are related to this dotNet useage.
    winelib (new)
        Bugs during winelib useage but not during useage through
        windows native executables.
    ports (new)
        Bugs regarding porting to specific platforms or OSs.
    FIXME
        needs clarification
    tasklet
        needs clarification
    tasklist
        needs clarification
    Abandoned? -> needmoreinfo
        This is currently discussed in another thread.
    filesystem (new)
        Do we want such a component? Is it maybe related with
        console? What exactly should it cover? Only things that
        possibly can destroy data? 
    console (new)
        I didn't really made my mind up about this one yet...

As far as I read, we decided to create the dlls/d3dx9_** directories, use the latest one for all the code
and forward all calls from older dlls to this one. However, I don't think that it is a problem if a dll contains
more functions than the native dll, so we could also just use 12 (sth. around that) copies of the same dll.

And about starting development: I have already began to implement the D3DXRenderToSurface interface,
but I'm new to COM programming so the progress is quite slow, so I'd recommend someone other to do the
base of the dll. A suggestion I'd like to do is a message that Wine should print out when a program wants to
use the d3dx9 dll, sth. like:
        MESSAGE("The application you want to run makes use of the D3DX9 library!n");
        MESSAGE("tIts implementation under Wine is very young and far away from complete.n");
        MESSAGE("tYou may be better off using a native d3dx9_24.dll file.n");

inline is automatically disabled if the compiler doesn't support it.

There is demand.  Using the now _obsolete_help keyword, there are 7
bugs relating to the help APIs.

Yes it should be replaced with the appropriate components, whichever
Dlls they belong to.  We can start arranging those and then remove the
component when that's done.

Yes, the bug is either in wine-programs (wineconsole) or the console

Subject: question about fixing D3DRENDERSTATE_TEXTUREMAPBLEND
Message-ID: <4781CCCC.8030307@inbox.lv>

Hi.

I found some problems with D3DRENDERSTATE_TEXTUREMAPBLEND state =
D3DTBLEND_MODULATE in ddraw and handling the alpha channel. This old state is
currently mapped to texture stage states, with alpha part done as

IWineD3DDevice_SetTextureStageState(This->wineD3DDevice, 0,
WINED3DTSS_ALPHAARG1, WINED3DTA_TEXTURE);
IWineD3DDevice_SetTextureStageState(This->wineD3DDevice, 0,
WINED3DTSS_ALPHAOP, WINED3DTOP_SELECTARG1);

This isn't correct, I believe, because in some cases it should be taken from
diffuse color (Aliens vs Predator 1 depends on it). But the latter behavior
isn't correct in all cases either.

I found this description of this state on some random website via google:

"D3DTBLEND_MODULATE Modulate texture-blending is supported. In this mode, the
RGB values of the texture are multiplied with the RGB values that would have
been used with no texturing. Any alpha values in the texture replace the alpha
values that would have been used with no texturing."

http://www.hi.is/~snorri/SDK-docs/x/exten203.htm

I guess, this means that it either takes alpha from texture or from diffuse
color, depending on whether the current texture has alpha channel (which takes
priority). I've submitted a test for this to wine-patches that includes checks
with both kinds of textures. It passes on XP and thus supports that this is the
way it is supposed to happen. Unfortunately, this doesn't easily translate to
available texture stage states. So it looks like something more hacky is needed
to make it work correctly in all cases in wine. There are two approaches I can
think of:

1) introduce an internal D3DTOP_ value in wined3d that will map to texture alpha
or diffuse alpha, depending on the pixel format of the currently selected texture.

2) move D3DRENDERSTATE_TEXTUREMAPBLEND handling to wined3d;

So it would be nice if Stefan D?singer or maybe somebody else of d3d devs gave
me some directions - which approach (if any) is ok and acceptable for wine
project. I'll attach a diff with my current hacks that show how 1st approach is
about to look.

BTW, this worked in wine around 0.9.15

http://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/?a=blob;f=dlls/ddraw/opengl_utils.c;h=a2b021985acfe3fbae888cb0e954b8fb47c86db3;hb=0fa7170dc318a6624f960c49e459cb521d2ae999

There it wasn't mapping to texture stage states, but instead was using such call:

glTexEnvi(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE, GL_MODULATE);

 From what I read about GL_MODULATE, I'm not sure it always does exactly the
thing TEXTUREMAPBLEND=MODULATE is supposed to do, but with Aliens vs Predator it
worked better.

It could've been a depth buffer issue as well. I'm not exactly sure
what the state of the depth buffer is when the test is run, but in
general it appears the GF8 rounds slightly different compared to
previous nvidia cards.

Jan:

1.  I would give the original reporter less than six months to respond.  
I would wait no more than a month for a response before closing as 
abandoned.

2.  The purpose of needsmoreinfo is that the original reporter did not 
supply sufficient information to reproduce the reported problem.  If a 
reported problem can be tested, and the problem determined, then the bug 
should not be placed in a needsmoreinfo status.  Another status would 
apply, like NEW or CONFIRMED, at this point.

Just copy the DllMain from sfc/sfc_main.c for example.

As I said, I don't have this problem here. We first have to understand
why you have a different rendering than mine.

What is your locale ? (I have fr_CH.UTF-8)

Is it a font problem (missing &nbsp; character) ?

Does someone else here know about the difference we are seeing and how
to fix it properly ?

Just make WINE_DLL_PREATTACH return FALSE and wine will prefer the native

Dear Alexandre,

Thank you for your response.  With that little information I was able to

be so easy to do.  It's also a shame I had to send the inquiry through 
three different channels before getting an answer.

Thank you very much for your quick response.  I t made all the difference.

Respectfully,

It is with great sadness that I announce the closing of Falling Leaf
Systems, LLC. We set out over a year ago to provide users of both "old
and unsupported" as well as "alternative" Operating Systems the
ability to run the latest games for the PC. Unfortunately, Falling
Leaf Systems was unable to achieve that goal.

However, every ending tends to open another door for opportunity and
though we are saddened to announce our departure, we are almost as
excited to announce the immediate availability of ALL source code for
the Alky Project! It is licensed under the LGPL and includes both the
orginal Alky Converter source used to convert the popular Prey Demo to
run on OSX and Linux, as well as the alpha release of the Alky
Compatibility Libraries which attempted to provide a DirectX10
compatible runtime for Windows XP.  All of this is available at
http://www.fallingleafsystems.com/

We have also created some new forums on the site for users to discuss
the coming cycle of DirectX 10 based games. We hope that you'll pop in
there from time to time, and we also hope you join our mailing list to
receive an announcement in case some other Open Source project decides
to carry on the Alky banner.

We appreciate all your past support; Happy gaming!

Okay, I have a bit time now and tomorrow, so I'll probably have submitted a basic d3dx9 dll patch
until Wednesday. So I'll create a new d3dx9 directory inside dlls, but I'm not that familiar with
Wine's makefile system (not very much with makefiles in general honestly), so can anyone
tell me how to tell make that it should create several copies of our dll?

I don't think a non null-terminated MULTI_SZ string is very useful. Do
you really have an app that depends on this?

That depends. ;-)  You're right, it is not ISO C90, but it is in the
C99 standard which is now close to ten years old.

  % gcc -pedantic x.c -c -o x -std=c99
  % gcc -pedantic x.c -c -o x -std=c89
  x.c:3: warning: ISO C90 does not support flexible array members
  % gcc -pedantic x.c -c -o x
  x.c:3: warning: ISO C90 does not support flexible array members

Which compiler that we care about doesn't support this C99 feature?

That said, if you don't want to take the original patch, can we take
the one below?

Thanks,
Gerald

Use 4*sizeof(WORD) instead of the magic constant 8 for THUNKS.thunks,

Actually we do.

  % egrep -r "^(static )?inline " $WINE_SOURCE/ | wc -l
  2031

"inline" is pretty similar to flexible array members in that both were
not in C90, both are in C99, and both have been GNU extensions before
C99, so I'm not sure why we use one but not the other.

I know, but in the current code we do have WORD thunks[4] and later on we 
twice relyy on the magic constant 8 which comes from that (4*sizeof WORD).

Honestly, I'd hope my patch makes this code easier to grasp.  

It certainly would have helped *me* when first looking at this code! ;-)

We have the ANYSIZE_ARRAY macro in include/winnt.h for this exact purpose.

I'm not opposed to fixing it, but changing all strings to hex format is
not a good solution, it makes the file much harder to read and modify.

I don't know of any such application.
It's just an old bug and one of very few bugs marked as tasklets.
And it seemed very easy to fix, so i tried fixing it.
Plus it's different from the way windows XP does it.

If you think it should stay the way it is now, maybe it should be
resolved with WONTFIX?

Not really, no. I had a quick look at it, and it is at best a hello world 
implementation.

Looking at their D3D10 implementation, it is comparable to Andras' soc code, 
with the difference that Alky has a few lines to create a gl context and send 
off vertices, but Andras has written a D3D10.idl header. Adding the 
functionality of Alky to Andras' code is a matter of hours, if we do it the 
hacky way. So all in all I think that the not yet integrated d3d10 that Wine 
has is more advanced. (Andras: Do you plan to continue working on that 
somewhen?)

As far as other libraries go, there isn't much to see either. D3D9 isn't even 
comparable to the very first out-of-tree patch Oliver put onto Sourceforge 
years ago. No handling for stateblocks or shaders, no proper texture 
handling, no vertex arrays, etc. The other libraries are in a similar state. 
D3DX has a few math functions implemented, but we have all of that already 
thanks to David and the other D3DX hackers.

While the code may not be of any use for us(or anyone else, since Wine 
exists), Cody seems to have written a lot of code. It might not be comparable 
to Wine, which has enjoyed the work of almost thousand developers and is 
almost 15 years old, it seems to be quite some accomplishment for a project 
which has been developed by apparently one(two?) persons. (I have no 
comparison how Wine started though. I only had a Gameboy back then :-) )

And kudos to them for releasing the source!

http://www.xpregistrycleaner.com/embedded-null-characters/ claims
"some software vendors use the embedded-null registry key technique
as a way to enforce the software license agreement and to reduce the
ability of users to tamper with the license information stored in
these registry keys."

http://forum.sysinternals.com/forum_posts.asp?TID=6030 claims
"iuVCR (www.iulabs.com) 4.11.0.374" might be such an app.

http://forum.sysinternals.com/forum_posts.asp?TID=2628
says
"The Aladdin Privilege Software Commerce Platform (SCP) may be a
common denominator for instances of Registry keys with embedded nulls
detected by RKR.
... [One app that seemed to use them was] a free trial of Adobe
Acrobat Professional 6.0."

http://forum.sysinternals.com/forum_posts.asp?TID=8882&PN=1
mentions that Windows itself uses keys with trailing nulls for some things.

And of course there's all that splendid malware.

Embedded nulls should work just fine. The case that doesn't work is
string values that aren't properly null-terminated.

It would work, but this can't be changed now, the file format needs to
remain backwards compatible.

It turns out that it's fairly easy to use hex format only for
non-terminated strings, I put in a fix.

Got reminded but by the WWN that i wanted to send the numbers of authors.

$ for y in `seq 2002 2007`; do
    echo -n "Number of authors in $y: "
    git shortlog -s --since="$y-01-01 00:00" --until="$y-12-31 24:00" |
        wc -l
done

Number of authors in 2002: 185
Number of authors in 2003: 167
Number of authors in 2004: 183
Number of authors in 2005: 212
Number of authors in 2006: 195
Number of authors in 2007: 218

Well at least some of the code they created can be used to do something 
and help the project, and how knows, maybe one of them may join Wine and 
help.

Yes I almost forgot about the soc code, any ideas when will that code 
start being used in wine?

And thanks Alky, why not help wine?  ;)

D3DTA_TEXTURE has a somewhat strange behavior. If no texture is set, it 
behaves like D3DTA_PREVIOUS. Perhaps for alphaarg it behaves similarly if 
there is a texture, but it has no alpha. If that is the case, then I think it 
matches what you need for D3DTBLEND_MODULATE. Otherwise I think a private 
value like your D3DTOP_DX6MODULATE is the only way.

So I'd say test how D3DTA_TEXTURE should behave, maybe we implement it 
incorrectly at the moment.

I think the consent was to create one directory for each version, and make all 
but the newest wrap to the newest dll or d3dx8. This can be done via 
the .spec file, so no thunks have to be coded. If there are version 
differences, then we can implement them in the specific DLLs

Hi Austin,

-        case 0x32: /* ENABLE/DISABLE VIDEO ADDRERSSING */
+        case 0x32: /* ENABLE/DISABLE VIDEO ADDRRESSING */

That's still misspelled.

- * special virtualalloc, allocates lineary monoton growing memory.
+ * special virtualalloc, allocates linear monoton growing memory.


Monoton isn't a word.  Monotone is, as is monotonic, and
monotonically, which is probably what's meant.

-/* Volume functions derived from Alsaplayer source */
+/* Volume functions derivated from Alsaplayer source */

This change doesn't look correct to me.

Thanks for catching that/these. After looking at all these
misspellings, some of the incorrect start to look correct. I've got a
replacement patch ready, this time triple checked :-).

I changed it to monotonically. I wasn't sure what it meant, I was
correcting linear.

There was one correct and one incorrect spelling. I apparently
switched around my find and replace on that one. I fixed this as well.

I'm sending a replacement patch now. Sorry for the mistake. I'll be
more careful in the future.

A few issues:

1.
  *          DPMI_xalloc
- * special virtualalloc, allocates lineary monoton growing memory.
+ * special virtualalloc, allocates linear monoton growing memory.

Um... Probably should be 'linearly'.
But if you're opening the can of worms, might as well really
improve it.  I suspect this would be better:

  *          DPMI_xalloc
- * special virtualalloc, allocates lineary monoton growing memory.
+ * Try to VirtualAlloc the len bytes just past the last block we allocated
+ * If that's not available, try 64K beyond; if still not available, fail.

2.

-/* Volume functions derived from Alsaplayer source */
+/* Volume functions derivated from Alsaplayer source */

What?  What's wrong with "derived"?  "Derivated" isn't even a word?!

3.
-# include <unistd.h>
+#include <unistd.h>

That's not a spelling fix, and you would have to fix a whole
lot of those.  Best leave alone.

But what good is a malware study tool if the malware can trivially 
detect it's there? What if it doesn't infect the machine, but just run 
differently?

There are Windows tools that do similar things to what you need (check 
out the sys-internals web site), where the environment is much more 
close to the real thing.

Actually, Dan's question is the more interesting here - did the malwares 
work under wine?

I think it can be done without changing every string to hex.
How about adding \0 at the end of every null terminated sting,
and \0\0 at the end of proper REG_MULTI_SZ value which should
end with an empty string?

I might try to do that.

Is it possible to use a format like:

    Message="Hello"

[using the quotes to determine the start/end of the string - this
would require processing on the string data, though]

or

    Message=(5)Hello

[encoding the length in the stored data - this does not need any
processing, and counts any nulls if there are any]

I know that in windows we can found similar things, but with wine we can make a
first check, make a simple report, and send it to client.
Later, we can make a good manual analysis.

At the moment we can report quickly if a malware delete files, change registry...

"did the malwares work under wine?"
a lot of, :)

Think... if we dont get results, we must made a manual analysis...

Just using the TEXT macro is not good enough because it does not work 
on Unix. Check out the definition of STATUSCLASSNAMEA in commctrl.h for 
how this should be handled.

Why are you changing 'signalling' to 'signaling' in one place, but 
leaving it as is twice two lines down. Note that I'm not sure which form 
is right, but ispell is happy with both so it's possible both are ok.

Ispell caught steroscopic, and while investigating that, I corrected
signaling. I didn't notice the line below at the time.

Hold off the this patch Alexandre. It's apparently controversial,
since people don't like the whitespace change(s). If you want to apply
certain chunks feel free, otherwise, I'll get a less controversial
patch ready.

Just so I know, are we going with American or British English? There's
a lot of inconsistency, though the majority seems to be American...

I think there's a weak preference for American spelling, but I don't
see much reason to "correct" spelling from British to American
English.

We're not standardising on either, that is, both spellings should be 
considered valid. Any other course of action will only bring about 
flamewars.

IMO, the ok() tests in the child process are a bad idea (they won't be 
counted, nor returned as errors, by the parent process)
all the tests should be done in parent, see kernel32/tests/process.c for 
some example on how to do it properly

Wouldn't it be better to differ between the desktop and the Go versions?
Dunno if some games use the information that the Go versions are 
less-featured than the desktop versions, but might get us useful.

I'm seeing quite a few abbreviations. While they don't hurt anything,
they do give the code a slang tone. I personally think that wine is a
very professional project, and it's code should reflect that. While
this is obviously a very generic question, I wanted to clarify before
submitting some changes for these.

A few examples. These are all in comments, not in actual code, and I'm
checking to make sure compilation/tests still pass before submitting.
mem -> memory
init -> initialize
concat -> concatenate
nr/num -> number
infos -> information
manuf -> manufacturer

Etc. Anyone have any objections to these being changed? Call me a
grammar nazi, but it's easier to read when not shortened like that.

The only difference between the 7300go and the standard are the gpu clocks. The 7400go runs at the same gpu clock as the standard 7300, the 7300go runs at 100MHz less (at 350MHz instead of 450MHz). I would prefer to default to the non-go variant as well. And even consider merging the 7300 and 7400 detection and let that default to 7300 as both are the same. (a 7400go runs at the gpu clock of a desktop 7300 and there is no desktop 7400)

I object.  They're perfectly readable as abbreviations.  We try to
have as few style rules as possible, and not allowing abbreviations
goes too far.

I also object to removing abbreviations or Britishisms.

The key to being a successful spelling policeman
is to stick to noncontroversial spelling fixes,
and avoiding anything controversial or non-spelling-related.

No they aren't easier to read quite the contrary. They are part of the
normal jargon and easier to read/write; especially for non native
English speakers aka developers.

Oh, and removing words like "suck", "damn" (too bad "fuck" is missing)
and other swear words isn't a good idea either.

I ran a little test, it didn't show any differences in Wine or XP in such case 
(D3DTA_TEXTURE alpha selected and no alpha in texture pixelformat). This seems 
to give alpha=1.0. I found nothing on this at msdn, but it more or less makes 
sense (no alpha = opaque image). Do you think there would be any use in adding 
such test to ddraw/tests/visual.c?

I am a long time programmer and expect the include to be next to the # 
sign.  However, you are correct in that it does not break code, and if 
it is not broken, why fix?  Is it possible to indent the entire line by 
two spaces (I think it is not)?

This is an announcement for a new release of the Dynace Object
Oriented Extension to C and the Windows Development System.

Real briefly, Dynace is an OO extension to C which includes multiple
inheritance, meta object protocol (MOP), class library, native thread
support, garbage collection, and is well documented.  The system has
been in production use for over 10 years.

The Windows Development System is a Dynace class library which makes
programming GUI applications under Windows and Linux (WINE) very easy.
It also includes a library for SQL Databases, an interface to Java and
MzScheme, a custom resource editor, etc.

Besides 600+ pages of professional documentation, the system also
includes a language tutorial and a GUI and Database tutorial.

Dynace will run on almost anything with a C compiler.  It has been
tested on many different systems over the years.

The Windows Development System runs on Windows an Linux (with WINE).  This
is open source software.

This has nothing to do with window stations, so it doesn't belong in

Why isn't it possible to forward the functions of the other dlls to the d3dx8 ones?
Or is this just for keeping the code clean so that we don't have mixed d3dx8 and d3dx9_36 forwardings?

You can of course forward to d3dx8 if they are compatible, why not?

Probably not. I know there are (ancient) C compilers that will bark
when the # is not the first character in a line as the preprocessor
will then not see it as a valid preprocessor line and simply ignore
it.

Subject: Advapi32: Service Control RPC 
Message-ID: <001701c852f2$c7976450$4001a8c0@NATERS>

The current service control API directly accesses the registry for most
things.
In native those fucntions are simple wrappers around RPC calls to the actual
service.exe application. Mikolaj Zalewski offered about 3 months ago a
possible
aproach to implement the service.exe program.

In there the proxy code generated through widl directly calls various RPC
functions
to communicate with the service manager executable. When doing some tests
with native
advapi32 under Wine I found that those fucntions seem to be implemented by
simply
calling more or less directly NdrCallClient2. Widl obviously doesn't
generate code
yet using this API and I'm sure wire compatibility can be achieved without
using
NdrCallClient2.

But a few questions that came up here:
- How good or complete is Wine's NdrCallClient(2) implementation? Would it
be feasable
  to use it for the implementation of the service rpc calls?
- Assuming it would be not a whole lot of work to make NdrCallClient(2) work
for this,
  would it be desirable to use this API instead of the code generated by
widl currently
  from complexity and/or performance view?
- Of course this would mean that widl would have to support (some of) the
{Oi | Oic | Oif | Oicf}
  flags to generate the proxy code but as it seems the necessary code
generator at least
  for the client side would be fairly trivial as it is mostly just a wrapper
around
  NdrClientCall(2) and most of the nitty gritty work is done in in that
function.
  A midl generated proxy code using -Oicf looks at least quite trivial. 

Any opinions about this anyone?

Yes, we need to dig that out again. I forget what was blocking it being

Exactly. The whole point of IDL in DCE/RPC is that it is independent of 
the DCE/RPC implementation as long as the generated code conforms to the 
NDR rules. With Microsoft's implementation, most of the NDR rules are 
implemented in rpcrt4 and all the IDL compiler as to do is output code 
to call the buffer size, marshall, unmarshall and free functions in the 
right order. widl should be correct in this respect. (There are some 
shortcuts that midl/widl take for marshalling base types and the 
alignments would have to be correct for these, but these are simple to 
get right.)

There is no reason to use NdrClientCall2 for any purpose in Wine.

Pretty good, IMHO. We use exactly the code that's in Wine here at 
CodeWeavers for connecting to Exchange servers (the RPC code is 
MIDL-compiled code in DLLs used by Outlook).

No. Everything (except multi-dimensional arrays, possibly) can already 
be done by the code we output already. Adding code to output -Oicf proc 
format strings in widl would be possible, but unnecessary.

It also adds problems because gcc and MSVC have differing opinions on 
how to return unions from functions. For this reason, we have 
implemented NdrClientCall2 in Wine by pretending it returns a LONG_PTR 
instead. widl would have to decide on whether it wanted to be compatible 
with our signature of the function or the MS one.

It reduces code size (and on modern processors that is supposed to lead 
to performance gains), but that is the only advantage that it gives us.

He's translating it to Gerenglish. Maybe we should get a native speaker to do

Not easily. Mr. Bugs is set as a globalwatcher in the main prefs.

'globalwatchers'
     A comma-separated list of users who should receive a copy of every 
notification mail the system sends.

One way I see fixing this is to remove Mr. Bugs from the globalwatchers 
and log in as him and check all the types of mail we want him to 
receive. This is how we used to do it before the globalwatchers option 
was added. I'm not really sure of the ramifications of doing this.

Hi Ge, sorry I missed this.  I have some stylistic quibbles with your patch:

+static PSID GetUserFromToken(HANDLE Token)

shellpath.c uses the _ prefix for static functions.  It's not pretty,
perhaps, but please be consistent.

@@ -1371,6 +1417,9 @@ static HRESULT _SHGetUserProfilePath(HANDLE

  LPWSTR pszPath)

     HRESULT hr;

+    PSID CurrentUser;

These have the wrong scope, as they're only used...

within this block.

But even fixing this, I think it'd be clearer to do something like the
following:

-     if (hToken != NULL && hToken != (HANDLE)-1)
+     if (hToken != NULL && hToken != (HANDLE)-1 &&
!_IsCurrentUserToken(hToken))

That is, make a function that checks whether the token represents the
current user, and returns TRUE if so/FALSE if not.

If I recall correctly, it was changed to globalwatcher because wine-bugs
wouldn't receive a copy of bug changes any more if the bug wasn't
assigned to him and you didn't explictly add him to cc.

Ah.  OK, can we put in some ad hoc filtering there to
remove just a few noisy sources of emails?

This is likely related to the extra security changes added to
/etc/sysctl.conf (vm.mmap_min_addr = 65536).  As a work-around, set this
to 0.  Hopefully wine can be built in a way that it doesn't have to
reserve the lower 64k all the time.

Hi,
As it was in David Adam's patch case, here also you are forwarding  
d3dx8.D3DXVec3Normalize as D3DXVec2Normalize.
I think it's a typo and strikes me so much because it's a first line of  
the specfile.
I'm new to Wine, so please correct me if I'm wrong.

I'm myself not exactly sure what the reasons where. It looks pretty ok
to me except that the way it is now with no real parameter verification
in the API function itself anymore before calling into the proxy stub,
the test framework will cause various debugger breaks because of the
RpcRaiseExceptions() in the proxy stubs. Also Mikolaj himself mentioned
at one point that this is not ready for commitment yet and I guess that
might influence Alexandre's decision quite a bit :-)

Ok, but I have made some parameter protocols to NdrClientCall2
from native advapi32 and believe that using those MIDL format
informations could allow to make an idl file that would result
in a fully wire compatible protocol to the MS services.exe one.
It's not exactly trivial to decode the MIDL_ProcFormatString
but by verifying the generated MIDL generated code against those
protocolled parameters would certainly help a lot. A first not
through check seems to indicate that almost every service control
API has its own services.exe rpc message, so no ANSII to Widechar
translation in the Advapi32.dll! Probably because there was a
services.exe implementation before the widechar APIs got introduced.
Also the protocol message numbers seem to have some holes, probably
some undocumented APIs here.

Isn't te difference with structs too?

Ok I let it at the way widl generates the svcctl code for now.
It's not like that code generates MBs of code and if widl is
good enough for most datatypes already then let it work that
way. It's also possible that the performance gain by the smaller
code is compensated by the more direct Ndr routine calls compared
to NdrClientCall(2) which has to marshall the data entirely based
on its own runtime type format parsing.

Agreed, but there's another occurrence of this check in msvcrt_argvtos
which has been there all along. Did Coverity spot that one too?

We really don't want to do development in that way. It would be much 
better to use the information that Samba have gained in a clean way 
combined with documentation with the equivalent Win32 function to figure 
out the compatible IDL file.

This kind of work has already been done and the interface fairly well 
documented, so I'll point you at this documentation:

Yes, but way down the list. I am usually just looking at the latest

Please stop resending that big patch again and again, it's not going in,
it's full of problems. You need to provide correct forwards for all
functions instead of stubs, and the functions need to match the Windows
ones, you can't just copy the same spec file 12 times. Also the code was
written by David, you have to use his name in the changelog, and you
shouldn't add your copyright in all the files unless you make
significant changes.

Hi,

What is the preferred number of spaces of indentation? In
comdlg32/colordlg.c it is either one or three spaces and there are a
few places where there is no indentation and where things are randomly
indented or switches between amounts of indentation.

What is the policy on when to change indentation and other things like
turning something like this:

    if (condition)
    {
        ...some code...
        return 0;
    }
    return 1;

into

    if (condition)
        return 1;

    ...some code...
    return 0;

The page on style
(http://www.winehq.org/site/docs/winedev-guide/style-notes) only
contains very little on coding style.

Another question, would it be OK to use smooth gradients in the colour
dialog? It could be slow on older computer accessing each pixel
individually although the code is only run on startup.

Some of wine's code is a mess with indentation, but alexandre won't
commit indentation patches.
This basically means that if there are multiple styles of indentations
in the same file, you have to pick the one that is around the place
where you put your function, although secretly when Alexandre isn't
looking I sometimes pick the preferred '4 spaces' one.

Explicit patches that only do that are not accepted as far as I know,
because it introduces bugs as you just skillfully demonstrated. ;-)

However if you are rewriting the function you might end up doing that
simplication in the process.

Oops, I was thinking about inversing the condition while I was writing it :)
- if (condition)
+ if (!condition)

What about if I change one line or add a line in a small function
(approximately 15 lines). Will I be allowed to change the indentation
or do that simplification above? The one line indentation makes it
difficult to see the code structure sometimes and I also prefer the 4
spaces one.

Okay, I now have spent some time on analysing the differences of the dlls
(at least regarding to what functions they provide). So just a few questions
from my side to make sure the next version of the patch will be what you expect:
1. Really just to ensure that one: You DO want me to forward even the stubbed
functions to the "d3dx9_36 stubs", don't you? If there's more to the forwards,
then tell me please.
2. Regarding the copyright thing, I'm really sorry for ignoring David's copyright, I'll
change that back. However, you didn't mean the git changelog with
"use his name in the changelog", did you?
Well, if you did, It'd be possible to mention both, as I'll have rewritten all
the specfiles. (It's not that I wouldn't respect David for his work, but the
time I spent on this shouldn't be left out either)
3. When it's ready, should I post my patch to a pastebin and ask at #winehackers
first if it's ok like that?
4. Is there anything other that I should correct?

All functions that can be forwarded must be forwarded, you don't want to
have to go back and fix 12 spec files every time one is implemented. If
some functions are not compatible then of course they shouldn't be
forwarded. You need to verify this for each function.

If you have really rewritten them, then of course they are copyright by
you. If all you did is s/d3dx8/d3dx9_36/ (as seems likely since you have
the exact same bugs) then David should be credited for them.

> 3. When it's ready, should I post my patch to a pastebin and ask at #winehackers

Yes, and then you should submit first a standalone d3dx9_36, and once
this is applied, a single other dll like d3dx9_24, and not worry about
the other ones until you can get that one in.

I haven't tried doing serial I/O with it, but it installs

give it a spin, it might turn up some problems.
(Or maybe they were just using an old version of wine, who knows.)

Does anyone use gdb attach to debug pthread winelib applications? I've had a
lot of problems with winedbg and winedbg --gdb, but have gdb attach working
well except I can't debug threads.  Breakpoints in threads crash the app and
I have no thread info.

gdb attach works fine with non-winelib pthread test cases.

Subject: Dereference of null ptrs after an ERR has been executed
Message-ID: <47873A39.2050806@yless4u.com.au>

What is the policy for handling the dereferencing of pointers that have 
previously been determined to be NULL and an ERR message has been 
issued.  It seems that there are many cases where Coverity has found 
that the test is made but the code falls through to the dereference.  In 
a number of cases to a TRACE.  Are we trying to throw an exception in 
these cases but assuming that the problem is unlikely and not worth 
further handling.  Essentially, it seems that if this is the policy then 
we can mark the Coverity entries as ignore.  In some cases it seems that 
the only problem may be the TRACE and there is no other reference which 
implies that an else may solve the problem ie.

if (!ptr) ERR "msg"
else TRACE

The other solution is to get the Coverity people to recognise the 
circumstance and not report it.

It doesn't make sense to check an RVA against PointerToRawData.

Oh, yes. I need more coffee :) And I should have been test native -
native doesn't even bother to search section unless it is file mapping
(MSDN is at least not complete, as usual). I'll send new version shortly.

That or we could modify the TRACE to use wine_dbgstr_[aw](ptr).

That sort of code doesn't make much sense. Either a null pointer is
valid input and it should be handled properly, or it isn't and there's
no point in having an ERR, we might as well crash and get a full
backtrace.

This will probably give some fallout ;)

I wanted to write earlier, but did forget about it over the last
days.

For my grown Wine installation this now starts:

- 2 instances of a Windows Worm
- Google Talk (not working)
- Skype (crashing)
- pccam.exe from some digital camera disk
- the annoying Steam.exe auto-update and ask-for-subscription dialog
- perhaps more

and this even on "make check" :(

We probably need some tool to edit Run and RunOnce entries now.

Ciao, Marcus

Works as it is supposed to then :-)

I agree it is a pain with "make test" though, and some way to easilly edit 
these keys would be helpful

maybe we need a tool like msconfig for managing services or a page on winecfg.

Id say so, a one stop place for anything that has a chance to get
executed on startup:

* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunServices
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunServicesOnce
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunOnce\Setup
above are listed from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/137367
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx
* HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
* HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows
* autoexec.bat
* config.sys
* startup folder
* system.ini


Any other areas that windows uses to launch programs when starting up?

Agreed, and be able to disable them entirely, I have a program that
crashes during autorun, so my virtual wine desktop wouldn't close even
with nothing visible.

wine regedit

Maybe it would be a good idea to have an option to make us of this new
feature...

Subject: Sibelius Scorch Setup Problem.
Message-ID: <4787D6D1.8040408@blueyonder.co.uk>

Trying to install this software 
(http://www.musicnotes.com/download/SetupScorchNS.exe) to display music 
scores I get the following problem.  After the initial dialog, another 
dialog is displayed for a fraction of a second then the installer 
crashes with the output below.  Is this a wine problem ?  Ijust 
downloaded and installed the latest (0.9.53) version.

I've found Mike Lin's Startup Control Panel
(http://mlin.net/StartupCPL.shtml) very useful for this on windows. It
appears to work on Wine, though I don't seem to have any Run or
RunOnce entries so can't be sure.

Running the tests now hangs for me waiting
for me to click "OK" to the gecko download dialog.

Is that something we want to fix, or should
I just do 'winetricks gecko' before starting the tests?

Message-ID: <a71bd89a0801120018w111f4714j33d14917efd639e6@mail.gmail.com>

Seeing as we have about 45 open riched20 bugs,
and some recent regressions, I figured it'd be
useful to add riched20 to winetricks.

Incidentally, since I lost the workstation that had
the old rcs repository it was in, I gave in to modern
times and put it in a new repository at
  http://code.google.com/p/winezeug/
- Dan

p.s. I have a backlog of two or three big updates,
one from Lei for codecs, and another from
Andrea Bocci for all sorts of things.
I'd merge them now but I have to go read another
Discworld book... they're like crack...

Subject: Bug audit status
Message-ID: <a71bd89a0801120039o3d6a1802n5b05ce498f3e43b2@mail.gmail.com>

Since Vijay suggested doing a bug audit two weeks ago,
the number of open bugs has dropped by about 300, or 10%:
http://bugs.winehq.org/reports.cgi?product=-All-&datasets=NEW%3A&datasets=UNCONFIRMED%3A
That was quite a burst of activity!

There are still 1800 bugs that haven't been touched in
over 90 days (137 of them reported by me, alas),
so we have a lot of auditing and retesting left to do.

BTW, James Hawkins suggests that we consider bugs abandoned
if the reporter doesn't respond within 90 days
(we had, I think, been letting them sit longer),
which seems reasonable to me.

We might want to add an option for only executing these on wineboot.
Hell, we might want to make this the default unless the user has a new
Wine installation made with wineprefixcreate.

As it is, this change might break things.

Yes, the templates for the emails are in git with the rest of
bugzilla. We just need to be carefull to not throw off anything
that parses these mails. Patches welcome.

We could change that mailinglist to not accept mail from anything
else than bugzilla.

Please don't filter the mail sent to wine-bugs (it also serves as
a complete backup and change tracker of the bugzilla). However it
should be easy to filter the mail you receive: There is a
X-Bugzilla-Changed-Fields header in mails from bugzilla which
contains only "CC" if that was the only field changed. The
problem is that there is no header for an added comment so you
would not want to throw away messages that contain "--- Comment"
at the beginning of a line in the body.

I know it can easily take a month for me to reply to a bug,
especially when it requires testing to determine the content of
my reply. Bug reports that are waiting for a reply can be flagged
as such and thus can be filtered and thus they shouldn't bother
anyone.

I agree. Neither should such a bug be flagged "Abandoned?" or
resolved abandoned.

Message-ID: <4788AE06.5050005@gmx.net>

..also, a very good utility to handle the autorun stuff is autoruns.exe from the Sysinternals Suite.
Actually, the whole suite is a very good testbed for wine as it contains low level monitoring tools
like Diskmon.exe, Filemon.exe, Tcpview.exe, procexp.exe, portmon.exe, Winobj.exe.. many of those
fail on module:NtLoadDriver stub but some like process explorer or the autoruns tool work almost
perfectly fine. Running the splendid bluescreen screensaver would be totally awesome too, but that
needs native ntoskrnl.exe to fetch the bootlogo..
by the way yes, sysinternals has been bought by M$ mid 2006, and of course the first thing they did
is introduce a nasty legal pop-up to all of the utils, but having a short look at it we should be
fine using it to debug WiNE ;)

	Patches with whitespace changes only are unlikely to be accepted and patches 
with tabs probably will not be accepted too. Therefore I suggest to fix 
formatting in your main patches themselves instead of fixing this with 
additional patch.

It is configured to do just that; so the emails just
end up in the list moderation queue, which
(presumably?) is only seen by me.  I've been posting
people's replies in Bugzilla myself, so they don't get
lost forever.

What are the tab settings in your editor? All white space in your

Until someone comes up with the addition to winecfg to edit the Run and
RunOnce keys (and it really seems like that is what we need), we should
probably detect if those keys have changed and pop up a dialog on the next
wineboot that says: "The Run or RunOnce registry keys have changed, probably
because you installed a new application.  We're now going to execute them,
but be prepared for something to explode and steal your lunch money.  You

Winecfg is not really the place for it. Windows power users expect to
have msconfig....its a shame we can't lift the one from ReactOS
because they have a working LGPL replacement.

OK, new winetricks up, with new packages
  vcrun2005sp1
  vcrun2008
  xvid
  ffdshow
and new pseudopackages
  allfonts
  allvcodecs
It no longer picks a particular sourceforge mirror, which

And mono12 is updated to mono-1.2.6.

Since the follwoning functions are not  implemented in the MS 
implementation.
SetSize, CopyTo, Commit, Revert, LockRegion, UnlockRegion, and Clone

They should be TRACE and not ERR.

Subject: Improving Default Serial Port Configuration
Message-ID: <781397410801122119s5f5d3e48h7e2d0890242f16be@mail.gmail.com>

I am looking to fix a bug causing serial ports to not show up in some
applications. The problem is due to missing registry entries for the
serial ports. I know what entries need to be created but I don't think
they should go in wine.inf. They should get created dynamically,
preferably on each run, based on what currently exists in
.wine/dosdevices/

The bug I am working on is 9902 (http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9902).

Does anyone have any insight on where I should start looking to
implement this? Implementation suggestions? In the bug, Juan Lang made
the suggestion that "Explorer's hal.c should be extended to create new
devices for all the ports it finds, using SetupDiCreateDeviceInfo
followed by SetupDiRegisterDeviceInfo. For some devices it should also
call SetupDiCreateDeviceInterface to register a particular interface."
I've looked in programs/explorer/hal.c and I am not sure where to
begin hooking something like that in.

It was also suggested in #winehackers that this could go in the same
place that other hardware like disk drives are detected and
configured. I am not sure where that would be either or if that is the
same as hal.c.

I am new to wine development to please feel free to over explain.

Thanks,

Why not? Was it reverse engineered? Or is there some other reason

The general policy is to no longer accept code from ReactOS though the
Wine taskmgr and registry editor were developed by ReactOS developers.
It should be obvious that its cleanly implemented so I don't know if
there is any way Alexandre would make an exception to import it. There
is really nothing to be reversed from this tool and Colin's version is
under the correct license so I don't see any reason why it should be
rejected. Its not like its some low level library without
documentation or anything. If we can't merge it due to policy then I
think taskmgr and regedit should be remove from Winehq git.

I don't see why winecfg can't have a page similar to what msconfig has.
It not hard to add it to winecfg, there is nothing magic in the reactos
version.

This is true. I am just saying most windows power uses expect msconfig
to be there these days. We could have a dummy msconfig thats just a
wrapper and invokes winecfg on the correct page. Being as we don't
follow the design windows power users expect by having CPL applets and
the like, it would make sense to stick it in winecfg with everything
else I guess...

And a flag to turn off this behaviour. So far I've never had a setup

My impression was that Wine follows the requests and demands of Linux
(and other supported OSes) users, not the Windows' ones regardless of
their powerfulness.

For instance Microsoft Office finishes its setup process when being run

Subject: SVN usage for Wine
Message-ID: <478977BA.6070302@earthlink.net>

Because git is unstable on the Mac platform, I've been utilizing a 
little time investigating the use of either SVN or CVS to download .git 
updates.  This appears to not be working per the Wiki pages for SVN. 

Is CVS or SVN still being supported for Wine or is git the only 
supported download (I don't expect to do any patching for now) method 
for .git updates?

Thank you.

James McKenzie

Well most Windows power users are used to a graphical registry editor
where Wine supports a text registry and we all know how much Linux
users love flat text file manipulation. Perhaps we should revert the
graphical registry editor for this and reasons I mentioned in the
prior email....

There are quite a few installers that use RunOnce to get around file
locking, but I still haven't had to use one fortunately. As I said, as
long as I can disable it. RunOnce wouldn't even have to be disabled,
I'd be happy with a "RunOnce wants to execute 'foo.exe blipp blopp',

I'd like to know where and when SetupDiRegisterDeviceInfo gets called on
Windows. I know that Alexandre is planning to move drive detection from
explorer to mountmgr.sys, serial devices will probably end up in serial.sys
or something like that. Perhaps this could work by making the driver itself

	I see no reason to revert currently abailable tools without *really good* 
technical or legal reason. Sorry but this would be simply... not smart, 
really.
	I like the ability to edit registry directly with text editor but this 
doesn't mean that I don't need GUI tool for that. Reasons are simple: with 
GUI I have tree with registry keys and with plain text I have sequence of 
registry keys. I think it is obvious why one would prefer tree instead of 
sequence in some cases and sequence instead of tree in other cases.
	BTW, msconfig isn't very popular tool. Just compare how many Windows users 
have used regedit and how many have used msconfig (and how freqently it is 
used in comparison with regedit). And of course many Linux users simply don't 
know about it. This means that even if we include msconfig its use will not 
be as intuitive as winecfg use for purpose of editing startup keys. Therefore 
winecfg is better for that purpose. In fact, use of winecfg will be obvious 
for all WINE users - including Windows power users.
	If we can include msconfig - good, but in my opinion its inclusion doesn't 
mean that winecfg shouldn't support editing of startup keys. Therefore, its 
inclusion or rejection isn't important to WINE Project (in other words, this 
is minor issue). As I said, winecfg is more convenient and intuitive for that 
purpose.

	If you disagree with WINE policy related to ReactOS you need to talk to AJ 
directly (for example, on IRC channel).  Multiple requests to exclude existing 
tools on wine-devel without good reasons will not help to make WINE or its 
current policy better, really.

Because it was asked:

We have to move all (including closed) bugs from a component into
others to remove that component. If an component is not empty
when it's removed all it's bugs also get removed.

But there is also the possibility to just leave obsolete
components around forever.

_obsoletet_help is a component. Should we perhaps add a keyword
"helpapis"?

No, the winhelp API is in user32 and winhelp.exe is under programs.
We do need an hhctrl.ocx component though.

I've switched the components to unknown on the following components,
so they can be removed:

console
directx-dshow
help
ipc
ports
resources

These are the counts of the remaining obsolete components:

binary - 1193
directx - 375
files - 137
gui - 358
multimedia - 139
winelib - 143

I'll correct these components at a rate of about 100 a day so as not
to spam the list too much.

I'd agree to that, but we could also do it at installer runtime, i.e. we check
in the Windows SetRegistryKey function(don't know the real name) if the key is
autostart related, interupt the installer program and ask the user if he
wants to allow that. The method of asking the user at RunOnce has IMO
the disadvantage that the user may not know what installer added
the RunOnce entry anymore (because it's a couple of days ago that the
last Wine instance was running or so).

The policy regarding ReactOS is not going to change and I really don't
care at this point. My point in reply to Dmitry's comment was while I
agree using winecfg for msconfig functionality is fine I was just
using a reductio ad-absurdum to point out that if we are not going to
make a wrapper program for msconfig for power windows users that are
used to certain windows functionality because we don't care about them
and the windows way of doing things, then why should we care about
windows power users ablity to graphically edit the registry? In
regedits case there would be two fold argument for removing it, 1.
Because it was contributed by ReactOS developers and 2. Because we
obviously don't care about whats convenient to people coming from a
windows background using that logic.

	Because it is important for MOST Linux users who use WINE. Of course some 
users use regedit rarely, some frequently - but fact is that they are using 
it. For example, I use it but I know very little about Windows.
	Most users will expect ability to edit startup keys in winecfg. And rest of 
users who didn't expect it to be there will learn about it very quickly - as 
soon as they run winecfg at least once.
	As I have already said, use of winecfg will be intuitive for both Linux and 
Windows power users. I simply see no problem here.
	I'm sure that there will be very little number of users who would use 
something else instead of winecfg when winecfg will have a tab for 
configurion startup keys.

> Because we
> obviously don't care about whats convenient to people coming from a

	"We shouldn't care about Windows power users" != "we shouldn't care 
about Linux users". Please note that I say nothing here about should we care 
about Windows (power) users or not. I'm just pointing that your logic isn't 
correct.
	I try to explain why. First of all, msconfig and regedit cannot be compared 
like two utilities of same importance or like two programs intended for same 
audience.
	regedit is extremely popular, its use is intuitive for most Linux users, and 
it cannot be replaced with a tab in winecfg. It even cannot be replaced with 
external Linux tools like text editor because wineserver will overwrite any 
changes that was made by an external program (this is true of course only if 
wineserver was running; you need to shutdown it before using external program 
for registry editing).
	msconfig is mostly intended for Window power users, its use isn't intuitive 
for most Linux users (in fact, it even isn't intuitive for most Windows users 
too), and it can be replaced with a tab in winecfg (at least, its most 
important functionality).
	As you can see, there is a big difference. It is incorrect to ignore 
importance of regedit for Linux users. Why? Because if msconfig was very 
important then it (or at least its simplified replacement) can be even 
written from scratch. This is true for regedit but isn't true for msconfig.  
In other words, it is unlikely that someone will write it from scratch in 
near future because of very low demand; but if WINE will lack regedit utility 
it is very likely that someone will write it from scratch if necessary.
	That just means regedit is important not only for Windows power users but for 
most of WINE users (including simple Linux users who are using WINE).

On my machine, we've been hovering between
five and ten test suite failures for some time
(see http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9916 )

IMHO one of the hallmarks of 1.0 should be reliably
getting zero test suite failures.
That would make regressions stand out like sore thumbs
instead of requiring developers to diff results
before and after their changes, and might
result in fewer regressions getting committed.

How 'bout folks spend some time tracking
the current six odd failures down and cleaning them up?

L. Rahyen:

I have found that I CANNOT contribute code to this project.  However, 
this does not stop me from contributing my USD .02. 

Regedit serves a single purpose, editing the registry.  msconfig serves 
the purpose of editing the configuration of Windows and as a Windows 
'hacker' I live on this program.  Of course, for simplicity's sake this 
can be a tab in winecfg, but for a Windows user/hacker moving to 
Linux/Wine adding a symlink to winecfg and the appropriate tab would be 
acceptable, but overlooking this requirement is not 'a good thing'.  And 
adding the suprise of running Run Aways and Run Once is not nice.  A 
warning in the announcement would be nice and almost necessary for those 
folks running a combination Windows/Linux box, like I used to.  This was 
to overcome the massive number of Windows 'friends' like Storm.  So, I 
would implore the investigation of adding the necessary parts of 
msconfig to winecfg and before the actual release of Wine 1.0.

BTW, regedit is an absolute necessity to the Wine project, but it is 
also a very dangerous tool in the wrong hands.

Thank you.

Where are you getting your git code from and does it require any patches

Perhaps 'binary' could be automatically renamed to 'unknown' to avoid
too much of manual work? Others can be checked/renamed manually.

I was wondering the same thing.  The other components were short so I
went ahead and changed those, but it would be great if we could
"rename" the remaining components to unknown.

Sounds like a worthy goal IMO.  It seems theres much more than 5 or 6
things which need work though:
http://test.winehq.org/data/200801121000/   Perhaps we should try and
have the nightly suite also pass all tests -- or is this too much of a
frivolous goal?

Not a pretty picture, is it?
But I was only referring to the tests that fail on Wine; there,
we have control over both the test and the code, so if
we can't get those tests passing, we're pretty weak :-)

> Perhaps we should try and

Getting all tests passing on Windows XP would be great,
but it's a lot of work.   It'd be less work if we focused on just the tests
that are failing on *all* Win XP systems, but that's still
at least 180 ok's that aren't ok.  Let's at least fix the 5 or 10 that are
failing on Wine, and try to keep them fixed.

Are these tests passing (now) on Alexandre's machine? I thought he didn't apply 
patches that break the wine tests? (at least on his box).

Why XP? Doesn't that mean our default should be XP as well?

	I agree that it would be great to add additional tools such as msconfig. If 
it would be added we can make a tab in winecfg (or button in intuitive place 
of winecfg) for just running it. This would be intuitive for all users.
	However as I said if we cannot include it there are "more or less" acceptable 
alternative way to solve the problem.
	Personally I prefer inclusion of msconfig and possibility to run it from 
winecfg (along with ability to run it directly as msconfig).

> And adding the suprise of running Run Aways and Run Once is not nice.

	Yeah, I remember how a lot of (mostly non-functional or partially functional) 
programs started automatically not only for me but also for my users (because 
of my multiuser setup).
	By itself this is useful feature. But lack of proper configuration tool in 
clean WINE is the real problem currently...

	This is certainly true.
