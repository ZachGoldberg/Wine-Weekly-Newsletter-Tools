19 days to code freeze (!)
</p><p>
Big news of the week is an apparant regression in one of
the release criteria apps.  Also, happily, two bugs I had
pushed off to 1.2 got fixed anyway (demonstrating the
honorary nature of the release manager position :-)
</p><p>
Changes since last week:
</p><p>
Deferred earlier, but fixed anyway:<br />
3534    user32  14      Systray icons are not transparent...
</p><p>
Deferred earlier, but patch that really fixes it submitted, so undeferred:<br />

<b>Winetricks updates</b>
<ul>
<li> Version 20080409 has the following changes:
  <ul>
  <li> Added winver=vista, since I found an app that refuses to install if winnt less than 502.</li>
  <li>Use curl and openssl instead of wget and sha1sum if needed (e.g. on mac), as suggested by Ryan Schmidt</li>
  <li>Use -nd option with wget, as suggested by Hin-Tak Leung</li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li> Version 20080408 has the following changes:
  <ul> 
   <li>
James Hawkins noticed that installing native dcom98 breaks everything
now because it breaks three of the .exe's that wine starts
internally.   So I've updated winetricks to avoid overriding
rpcrt4, ole32, and oleaut32 for those three exe.  Once
again, dcom98 is your friend.
    </li>
   </ul>
</li>
<li> Version 20080402 has the following changes
  <ul>
   <li>
       Added dotnet20, removed one kludge from dotnet11, added win2k
verb, plus shorthand for winver=foo
   </li>
   <li>
      Updated liberation fonts.
   </li>
   <li>
      Added flash verb.
   </li>
   <li>
       Fix i18n problem reported by Ricardo Cabral
   </li>
   <li>
       Added msls31 (seems to be needed by e-Sword)

   </li>
   <li>
       update mono12 to 1.2.9
   </li>
  </ul>
</li>
 

As always, winetricks is available at

<p>
Maarten Lankhorst has been hard at work adding support for iTunes and some of its more advanced features (non-iphone/itouch ipod syncing).  He writes in:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
Hi all,
</p><p>
I submitted the ipod patches to wine-patches. This won't add support
for ipod touch or iphones. I expect that all patches will be merged
soon. If anyone feels adventurous they can try it. With the amount of
people interested in it I decided to post an update on the mailing
list so that everyone who picked up on the earlier threads can find
it.
</p><p>
Instructions:<br />
- Apply attached <a href="http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/attachments/20080403/0799c8e5/attachment-0001.txt">patch</a><br />
- Get a clean wineprefix<br />
- Set wine version to vista<br />
- Download the installer from itunes.com, and install.<br />
- wine net start ipod\ service<br />
- run itunes<br />
- Hopefully the ipod is detected now. Dapper might have a bug in hald
which case it won't detect any usb hard drive that's plugged in. sudo
killall hald; sudo hald; wineserver -k; wine net start ipod\ service
seems to work as workaround.
</p><p>
So far there seems to be some confusion, so for the sake of clarity:
<i>This won't add support for ipod touch or iphones.</i>
</p><p>
Cheers,<br />
Maarten.

Dan Kegel is going to be talking on LUG radio.  Our most recent experience with LUG was <a href="http://www.winehq.org/?issue=336#Interview%20with%20Mr.%20Alexandre%20Julliard">Alexandre Julliard's interview</a> a few months back.
</p>
<p>You can find some material Dan wrote up for his talk <a href="http://kegel.com/wine/lugradiolive2008/">here</a></p>

<p>
I'm going to be giving a Wine talk at LugRadio Live 2008,
April 12-13, in San Francisco.
My talk is Saturday at 2:30; see
<a href="http://lugradio.org/live/USA2008/schedule">http://lugradio.org/live/USA2008/schedule</a>
</p><p>
In a mixup at my favorite coffeehouse today
(Stir Crazy), I was accidentally overcaffeinated,
and wrote my entire presentation in about one sitting.
It's online at
<a href="http://kegel.com/wine/lugradiolive2008/">http://kegel.com/wine/lugradiolive2008/</a>
The slides are pretty basic; I'll talk a lot around them.
If anybody feels like reviewing the slides
and giving feedback, I'd appreciate it.
</p><p>
If anybody's planning on attending the event, let's
get together for lunch or coffee or something.

<topic>Optimization</topic>
<p>
Steven Edwards recently sent in an interesting post about his efforts to compile wine with
compilers other than GCC for the sake of compiler-level optimizations:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
Hi,
Given we are coming up close to the freeze, I think this may be a good
time to look in to optimizations. I propose we spend some time trying
different compilers and profiling Wine under different usage patterns
to see what type of speedup we can get. I'm going to see if its
possible to compile Wine with LLVM and I think it would be a good idea
if someone with an ICC license gave it another shot. Also any gentoo
users lurking, now would be a good time to go crazy with your compiler
flags, run some benchmarks and file bug reports.
</p><p>

</quote>
<p>
There were of course some interested responses, some more concerned about the stability of 
compiling with GCC before even thinking of optimizing using others, Scott Ritchie:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
I'd settle for someone telling me which GCC version to use.  If you are
doing optimization testing, please make sure to test that copy
protection hasn't broken as well :)
</p><p>
Thanks,<br />
Scott Ritchie
</p>
</quote>
<p>
Steve responded that of course he would check for that, but at the moment wasn't even close to having
anything working!  After some more work he wrote in with the following:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
I wasted a bit more time on this than I should have but I was able to
get the 32bit icc to work on my 64bit host to compile Wine with a few
hacks. I've documented the process on the wiki and submitted Wine test
results. If anyone else has time, please try icc on a 32bit host and
let me know if you get a crash when compiling oleaut32. Later when I
have more time I am going to run some benchmarks comparing a directx
game under wine compiled with gcc and icc.

<p>
Jeremy White has begun the planning of this year's annual WineConf.  He writes in:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
Hi Folks,
I'd like to start the planning for WineConf 2008.
</p><p>
My sense is that 3 years in Europe and 1 year in the US
is a reasonable balance, so I feel it makes sense to
try to have it over here this year.
</p><p>
Further, I would like to host WineConf this year in St. Paul, Minnesota,
for a variety of reasons.  First, it's a lot easier for me to help
plan if it's here.  Second, it's nice for CodeWeavers; it means we
can have everyone, not just the developers, all together.  Having Mandi
able to physically intimidate people is very helpful for us, after all *grin*.
</p><p>
My thought was to do it in late September, early October, so
that the weather would not be so extreme.  I realize that veterans
of our last Minnesota meeting will be disappointed at the lack
of the Ice Palace, but we'll try to find a way to make it up to you.
</p><p>
Also, I know the travel costs will be hard for many people, given current
travel costs, so I'm hoping to contribute funds (and perhaps
do some fund raising) to help cover travel costs for Wine
contributors.
</p><p>
At any rate, that's my idea.  I'm willing to be swayed if people
object violently, or if a clear consensus for an alternate emerges.
</p><p>
Thoughts?  Comments?
</p><p>
Cheers,
</p><p>
Jeremy
</p>

<p>
Replies were mixed about a US based WineConf but overall the majority seems to be alright with Jeremy's proposal.  I look forward to seeing you all there!

	title="Versioning .wine directories"

<topic></topic>
<p>
There have been some issues with .wine directories brought up on the users list, causing a proposal to version the .wine directories to surface.  Dan kegel:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
On the wine-users list, we're getting a lot of users who
have old or even ancient .wine directories, and
whose problems go away with a fresh .wine directory
</p><p>
Perhaps we should have wineprefixcreate stamp the version
of wine the .wine directory was created with,
make wine-1.0 refuse to run with pre-1.0 .wine
directories, and require that future versions
of wine run properly with .wine directories created
by any earlier stable release of wine.
</p><p>
It wouldn't be hard, at least at first, and it might save a lot of
support inquiries.  What say?
</p>
</quote>
<p>
Austin English agrees and points to a bug where he mentioned this idea some time back:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
<a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9959">http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9959</a>
<br />
My comment from the bug:
"How about a little file in .wine  or a registry key that is read upon running
wine, and should match the current wine version. If it doesn't, call
wineprefixcreate (or pop up an error saying that the registry is outdated),
which then updates that key to the current wine version. Shouldn't be too much
overhead and prevents quite a few problems."
</p>
</quote>
<p>
Stefan D&#246;singer points out his own personal experience with .wine issues:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
In the past I've had more problems with wineprefixcreate trashing my registry
than I had with outdated registry entries. Especially if you have Internet
Explorer or the DirectX SDK or runtime installed running wineprefixcreate has
bad side effects.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
Austin English thinks the problem is still solvable though.
</p>
<quote>
<p>
We could still store the version of wine last used and issue a (gui?)
warning if it's old/outdated telling the user to either run
wineprefixcreate, which may be bad in some cases, or to reinstall
their apps.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
Alexandre Julliard writes in with an interesting perspective
</p>
<quote>
<p>
I think we should
stop telling people to blow away their .wine, and have them run
wineprefixcreate instead.  Then if wineprefixcreate doesn't do the
update correctly we need to figure out why and fix it.  Once we are
confident that it can do the update safely we can have it run
automatically when it detects an upgrade.

<topic>Firefox in Wine</topic>
<p>
WWN doesn't usually quote the user's mailing list however there was a 
very interesting post from a user.  I have not verified the claims present
 but that the user expressed them still makes it interesting:
</p>
<p>User rockinup1231 writes in (emphasis added):</p>
<quote>
<p>
I installed Java 1.6 update 5 and Firefox. Firefox works <b>"okay"</b>,
 and some elements like Flash objects (videos on youtube and cartoons 
on AlbinoBlackSheep to name some examples) work <b>a bit faster</b> than they 
do on the native linux version of Firefox, so I wanted to try Java. 
</p>
</quote>
<p>
The discussion veered off on a tangent for a while, and led to a quality post
about testing random things in general about Wine:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
Like me.  [Testing Windows Java and Firefox is] exactly the 
kind of think I like doing; it's a good test of wine.
If it doesn't work, I file bugs.  Like, oh, say
<a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4860">http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=4860</a>
Perhaps that's what the original poster was thinking.
</p><p>
One can imagine a real scenario where this would
be useful.  A user who wants to use one web browser
for everything, and is forced to use the windows version
of firefox by some awful windows-specific plugin,
might well want to install the Windows version of Java
and expect it to work.

</p>
</quote>
<p>
Dan Kegel also, in a different thread, wrote some comments about getting firefox 3 beta 4 to work in Wine:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
tried Firefox 3 beta 4 just now, and there were
a few bugs that stood out in the first few minutes:
</p><p>
12305           Firefox 3 beta 4 font problem: colon displayed as 0038
unicode glyph-missing glyph<br />
12306   Firefox 3 beta shows one-pixel-high black line when rendering some images<br />
12307   firefox 3 beta 4 crash on some web pages<br />
</p><p>
Youtube seemed slow and hangy on the first video I tried,
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwMj3PJDxuo">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwMj3PJDxuo</a>
although it was fine in native firefox at the same
time; perhaps the Windows version of the flash plugin
is less resistant to network errors -- or Wine doesn't
support some network feature that only matters during
bad internet weather.
</p><p>
That same video was fine later, as was a different video
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGxdgNJ_lZM">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OGxdgNJ_lZM</a>
(both worth watching, btw).
</p><p>
It also output quite a few messages like
fixme:ntdll:NtLockFile I/O completion on lock not implemented yet
fixme:font:ExtTextOutW flags ETO_NUMERICSLOCAL | ETO_NUMERICSLATIN |
ETO_PDY unimplemented
</p><p>
Firefox 3 rc1 will be out in May, and release will be in early June,
according to
<a href="http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2008/03/mozilla-final-v.html">http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2008/03/mozilla-final-v.html</a>
</p><p>
Given that a lot of people have in the past used windows Firefox
in wine to run native plugins, maybe we should get firefox 3
working well.  Probably only five or six main issues.

<p>
There have been a number of posts recently about more and more stuff beginning to work with .NET.  While not even .NET 1.0 is officially supported it seems that every day or two we hear about more .net (even partial) success stories.  Even .NET 2.0 is beginning to shape up:
</p>

<quote>
<p>
It looks like 'winetricks dotnet20' and current wine
is good enough that .net support isn't quite the
limiting factor anymore!  See
<a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8499">http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=8499</a><a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12457">http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12457</a><a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12458">http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=12458</a>
for three sizeable apps that actually put up
their GUIs, at least briefly.  MySQL Workbench
actually runs well enough to explore the GUI.
