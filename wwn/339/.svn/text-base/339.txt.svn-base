Subject: d3dx implementation senseless?
In-Reply-To: <E1JAoyU-0003xr-6E@www9.emo.freenet-rz.de>
Message-ID: <100822.54440.qm@web26005.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Since everybody agrees that we need a built-in d3dx9, we could begin to implement it.
In the last talk about it, no plan was found to implement it: does one create a wined3dx or implement on the top of the last d3dx9 dll?

So, I think that a definitive answer should be given very quickly.

I think you should be aware that Wine is no replacement for a security 
tool. If you run a malware using Wine, it is possible for this malware 
to interact directly with your Linux machine, bypassing your protection.

With controversy I was refering to the discussion before. Btw.
the last mail on that thread is now only 2 weeks old and was not
even one week old when Vitaliy sent the first mail in this
thread.

Anyone who wants to to do stuff is welcome, just speak up.

Afaik only selected users can reopen bugs. Users that can edit
bugs and the reporter can do that and if I remember correctly we
seem to want to also prevent the reporter from doing that.

Open bugs lingering in needmoreinfo or "Abandoned?" don't hurt.
Othoh closing bugs too quickly as invalid or abandoned may drive
bug reporters away which would hurt us in the long run.

If you'd just want to get less bugs we could have a special
permission for filing bugs and only let selected people who we
trust to report really useful bugs (though I think that is not
what we want).

Anyway the 12 month were only an example, I'm fine with 6 month.
I'm more concerned about closing bugs (e.g. as invalid) where
someone is active and disagrees.

It might make sense to rename "Abandoned?" to needmoreinfo, so
that one can key a bug as needmoreinfo and after x month with
that keyword and no response resolve it abandoned.

Though we probably don't want to use needmoreinfo on bugs where
it's possible for someone to retest if the bug is still there
(e.g. where there is a download for the application and the bug
is described sufficiently to check for it oneself).

I updated that wiki page a little, and added my and newman's photos of
wineconf, and the big group photo. Does anyone else have a photo album
they want to share? I created mine with picasa for linux, which uses wine.

Cheers,

Would it be better to have separate A/W painting functions?

Nothing that I can think of, but you know the code much beter than me.  It 
just seemed like you disagreed with the intention of my original patch as

Please don't apply this yet, it needs further research.
The valgrind manual tells us in the Client Requests section
that VALGRIND_MAKE_xxx functions return such a block handle [1],
But looking at the implementation of valgrind/adding traces to valgind DISCARD request
show it returns 0xffffffff ?

Greetings Peter

[1] valgrind manual Release 3.3.0 - 4.6. Client Requests
* VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_NOACCESS, VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_UNDEFINED and VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_DE
  These mark address ranges as completely inaccessible, accessible but containing unde?ned data, and accessible
  and containing de?ned data, respectively. Subsequent errors may have their faulting addresses described in terms
  of these blocks. _Returns a "block handle"_. Returns zero when not run on Valgrind.
* VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_DEFINED_IF_ADDRESSABLE. This is just like VALGRIND_MAKE_MEM_DEFINED
  but only affects those bytes that are already addressable.
* VALGRIND_DISCARD: At some point you may want Valgrind to stop reporting errors in terms of the blocks
  de?ned by the previous three macros. To do this, the above macros return a small-integer "block handle". You
  can pass this block handle to VALGRIND_DISCARD. After doing so, Valgrind will no longer be able to relate
  addressing errors to the user-de?ned block associated with the handle. The permissions settings associated with
  the handle remain in place; this just affects how errors are reported, not whether they are reported. Returns 1 for
  an invalid handle and 0 for a valid handle (although passing invalid handles is harmless). Always returns 0 when
  not run on Valgrind.

Be there or be a rectangular thing :)

Actually I started marking one up, but at one point in time run out of
names and time :/

Anyway, the result as I stopped:
http://www.lst.de/~mm/wineconf2007group_annotated.jpg

And the GIMP xcf with every name as another layer:
http://www.lst.de/~mm/IMG_1187.xcf		(26 MB)

If someone mails me what names to fill in where I can update it further.

Subject: Strange bash error "shell-init: error retrieving current directory"
Message-ID: <a71bd89a0801060836h4b5d5fcbj8ed3b3f32fb1155a@mail.gmail.com>

I've been seeing the error

shell-init: error retrieving current directory: getcwd: cannot access
parent directories: No such file or directory

a lot recently when running Wine, probably when installers
finish.   It started a couple weeks ago.
I think it's a bash error message.
Anyone else seeing that, or know what causes it?
(Do we run our wrapper script in a directory that goes away, say?)

Subject: bugzilla component and keyword cleanup
Message-ID: <20080106165555.GA4687@crissy.swd.zerebecki.de>

I'm done with one step of the changes.

See the following URLs for how things currently look:
http://bugs.winehq.org/describekeywords.cgi
http://bugs.winehq.org/describecomponents.cgi?product=Wine

Improvement suggestions are welcome.

Does anyone know how the CVS/GIT version is marked so that it
gets selected on the new bug page and if that is also possible
for the component?


Now for further improvements:

Changes which IMHO should not be done:
wine-help -> hhctrl - Help viewer implementation
    help is currently not for the various help APIs but for user
    that want help. We should obsolete this component. We can
    create a new component for the help APIs if there is demand.
(new) -> vdm - Wine 16-bit compatibility layer
(new) -> win16 - Wine 16-bit compatibility layer
    vdm is part of the component dos, right?
    A win16 keyword is probably useful as win16 support is
    intertwined in quite some other DLLs and thus components.

Components that are marked as obsolete now, but where it's not
sure how to replace them:
multimedia
    Should we really replace this? Replace it with what? An mci and winmm component?
console
    I didn't really made my mind up about this one yet...
files
ipc
ports
winelib
    Possibly replace each with a keyword, see below.

Changes to the keywords:
    conformance (delete)
        Delete this keyword, because it fits probably most wine bugs.
    testcase (new)
        Bugs that have a testcase attached, in source form but
        not necessarily integrated into the Wine test suite.
    win16 (new)
        Bugs in the win16 parts of Wine.
    dotnet (new)
        Bugs that appear in applications using dotNet and that
        are related to this dotNet useage.
    winelib (new)
        Bugs during winelib useage but not during useage through
        windows native executables.
    ports (new)
        Bugs regarding porting to specific platforms or OSs.
    FIXME
        needs clarification
    tasklet
        needs clarification
    tasklist
        needs clarification
    Abandoned? -> needmoreinfo
        This is currently discussed in another thread.
    filesystem (new)
        Do we want such a component? Is it maybe related with
        console? What exactly should it cover? Only things that
        possibly can destroy data? 
    console (new)
        I didn't really made my mind up about this one yet...

As far as I read, we decided to create the dlls/d3dx9_** directories, use the latest one for all the code
and forward all calls from older dlls to this one. However, I don't think that it is a problem if a dll contains
more functions than the native dll, so we could also just use 12 (sth. around that) copies of the same dll.

And about starting development: I have already began to implement the D3DXRenderToSurface interface,
but I'm new to COM programming so the progress is quite slow, so I'd recommend someone other to do the
base of the dll. A suggestion I'd like to do is a message that Wine should print out when a program wants to
use the d3dx9 dll, sth. like:
        MESSAGE("The application you want to run makes use of the D3DX9 library!n");
        MESSAGE("tIts implementation under Wine is very young and far away from complete.n");
        MESSAGE("tYou may be better off using a native d3dx9_24.dll file.n");

inline is automatically disabled if the compiler doesn't support it.

There is demand.  Using the now _obsolete_help keyword, there are 7
bugs relating to the help APIs.

Yes it should be replaced with the appropriate components, whichever
Dlls they belong to.  We can start arranging those and then remove the
component when that's done.

Yes, the bug is either in wine-programs (wineconsole) or the console

Subject: question about fixing D3DRENDERSTATE_TEXTUREMAPBLEND
Message-ID: <4781CCCC.8030307@inbox.lv>

Hi.

I found some problems with D3DRENDERSTATE_TEXTUREMAPBLEND state =
D3DTBLEND_MODULATE in ddraw and handling the alpha channel. This old state is
currently mapped to texture stage states, with alpha part done as

IWineD3DDevice_SetTextureStageState(This->wineD3DDevice, 0,
WINED3DTSS_ALPHAARG1, WINED3DTA_TEXTURE);
IWineD3DDevice_SetTextureStageState(This->wineD3DDevice, 0,
WINED3DTSS_ALPHAOP, WINED3DTOP_SELECTARG1);

This isn't correct, I believe, because in some cases it should be taken from
diffuse color (Aliens vs Predator 1 depends on it). But the latter behavior
isn't correct in all cases either.

I found this description of this state on some random website via google:

"D3DTBLEND_MODULATE Modulate texture-blending is supported. In this mode, the
RGB values of the texture are multiplied with the RGB values that would have
been used with no texturing. Any alpha values in the texture replace the alpha
values that would have been used with no texturing."

http://www.hi.is/~snorri/SDK-docs/x/exten203.htm

I guess, this means that it either takes alpha from texture or from diffuse
color, depending on whether the current texture has alpha channel (which takes
priority). I've submitted a test for this to wine-patches that includes checks
with both kinds of textures. It passes on XP and thus supports that this is the
way it is supposed to happen. Unfortunately, this doesn't easily translate to
available texture stage states. So it looks like something more hacky is needed
to make it work correctly in all cases in wine. There are two approaches I can
think of:

1) introduce an internal D3DTOP_ value in wined3d that will map to texture alpha
or diffuse alpha, depending on the pixel format of the currently selected texture.

2) move D3DRENDERSTATE_TEXTUREMAPBLEND handling to wined3d;

So it would be nice if Stefan D?singer or maybe somebody else of d3d devs gave
me some directions - which approach (if any) is ok and acceptable for wine
project. I'll attach a diff with my current hacks that show how 1st approach is
about to look.

BTW, this worked in wine around 0.9.15

http://source.winehq.org/git/wine.git/?a=blob;f=dlls/ddraw/opengl_utils.c;h=a2b021985acfe3fbae888cb0e954b8fb47c86db3;hb=0fa7170dc318a6624f960c49e459cb521d2ae999

There it wasn't mapping to texture stage states, but instead was using such call:

glTexEnvi(GL_TEXTURE_ENV, GL_TEXTURE_ENV_MODE, GL_MODULATE);

 From what I read about GL_MODULATE, I'm not sure it always does exactly the
thing TEXTUREMAPBLEND=MODULATE is supposed to do, but with Aliens vs Predator it
worked better.

It could've been a depth buffer issue as well. I'm not exactly sure
what the state of the depth buffer is when the test is run, but in
general it appears the GF8 rounds slightly different compared to
previous nvidia cards.

Jan:

1.  I would give the original reporter less than six months to respond.  
I would wait no more than a month for a response before closing as 
abandoned.

2.  The purpose of needsmoreinfo is that the original reporter did not 
supply sufficient information to reproduce the reported problem.  If a 
reported problem can be tested, and the problem determined, then the bug 
should not be placed in a needsmoreinfo status.  Another status would 
apply, like NEW or CONFIRMED, at this point.

Thank you for your explanation.

Nevertheless, it is not normal "::". See capture...

As I said, I don't have this problem here. We first have to understand
why you have a different rendering than mine.

What is your locale ? (I have fr_CH.UTF-8)

Is it a font problem (missing &nbsp; character) ?

Does someone else here know about the difference we are seeing and how
to fix it properly ?

So do I, don't worry.

Just make WINE_DLL_PREATTACH return FALSE and wine will prefer the native

Dear Alexandre,

Thank you for your response.  With that little information I was able to 
get my entire system working.  Two or three very simple examples showing 
all the steps in the docs would be worth their weight in gold and would 
be so easy to do.  It's also a shame I had to send the inquiry through 
three different channels before getting an answer.

Thank you very much for your quick response.  I t made all the difference.

Respectfully,

Blake McBride

It is with great sadness that I announce the closing of Falling Leaf
Systems, LLC. We set out over a year ago to provide users of both "old
and unsupported" as well as "alternative" Operating Systems the
ability to run the latest games for the PC. Unfortunately, Falling
Leaf Systems was unable to achieve that goal.

However, every ending tends to open another door for opportunity and
though we are saddened to announce our departure, we are almost as
excited to announce the immediate availability of ALL source code for
the Alky Project! It is licensed under the LGPL and includes both the
orginal Alky Converter source used to convert the popular Prey Demo to
run on OSX and Linux, as well as the alpha release of the Alky
Compatibility Libraries which attempted to provide a DirectX10
compatible runtime for Windows XP.  All of this is available at
http://www.fallingleafsystems.com/

We have also created some new forums on the site for users to discuss
the coming cycle of DirectX 10 based games. We hope that you'll pop in
there from time to time, and we also hope you join our mailing list to
receive an announcement in case some other Open Source project decides
to carry on the Alky banner.

We appreciate all your past support; Happy gaming!

Okay, I have a bit time now and tomorrow, so I'll probably have submitted a basic d3dx9 dll patch
until Wednesday. So I'll create a new d3dx9 directory inside dlls, but I'm not that familiar with
Wine's makefile system (not very much with makefiles in general honestly), so can anyone
tell me how to tell make that it should create several copies of our dll?

I don't think a non null-terminated MULTI_SZ string is very useful. Do
you really have an app that depends on this?

That depends. ;-)  You're right, it is not ISO C90, but it is in the
C99 standard which is now close to ten years old.

  % gcc -pedantic x.c -c -o x -std=c99
  % gcc -pedantic x.c -c -o x -std=c89
  x.c:3: warning: ISO C90 does not support flexible array members
  % gcc -pedantic x.c -c -o x
  x.c:3: warning: ISO C90 does not support flexible array members

Which compiler that we care about doesn't support this C99 feature?

That said, if you don't want to take the original patch, can we take
the one below?

Thanks,
Gerald

Use 4*sizeof(WORD) instead of the magic constant 8 for THUNKS.thunks,

Actually we do.

  % egrep -r "^(static )?inline " $WINE_SOURCE/ | wc -l
  2031

"inline" is pretty similar to flexible array members in that both were
not in C90, both are in C99, and both have been GNU extensions before
C99, so I'm not sure why we use one but not the other.

I know, but in the current code we do have WORD thunks[4] and later on we 
twice relyy on the magic constant 8 which comes from that (4*sizeof WORD).

Honestly, I'd hope my patch makes this code easier to grasp.  

It certainly would have helped *me* when first looking at this code! ;-)

We have the ANYSIZE_ARRAY macro in include/winnt.h for this exact purpose.

I'm not opposed to fixing it, but changing all strings to hex format is
not a good solution, it makes the file much harder to read and modify.

I don't know of any such application.
It's just an old bug and one of very few bugs marked as tasklets.
And it seemed very easy to fix, so i tried fixing it.
Plus it's different from the way windows XP does it.

If you think it should stay the way it is now, maybe it should be
resolved with WONTFIX?

Not really, no. I had a quick look at it, and it is at best a hello world 
implementation.

Looking at their D3D10 implementation, it is comparable to Andras' soc code, 
with the difference that Alky has a few lines to create a gl context and send 
off vertices, but Andras has written a D3D10.idl header. Adding the 
functionality of Alky to Andras' code is a matter of hours, if we do it the 
hacky way. So all in all I think that the not yet integrated d3d10 that Wine 
has is more advanced. (Andras: Do you plan to continue working on that 
somewhen?)

As far as other libraries go, there isn't much to see either. D3D9 isn't even 
comparable to the very first out-of-tree patch Oliver put onto Sourceforge 
years ago. No handling for stateblocks or shaders, no proper texture 
handling, no vertex arrays, etc. The other libraries are in a similar state. 
D3DX has a few math functions implemented, but we have all of that already 
thanks to David and the other D3DX hackers.

While the code may not be of any use for us(or anyone else, since Wine 
exists), Cody seems to have written a lot of code. It might not be comparable 
to Wine, which has enjoyed the work of almost thousand developers and is 
almost 15 years old, it seems to be quite some accomplishment for a project 
which has been developed by apparently one(two?) persons. (I have no 
comparison how Wine started though. I only had a Gameboy back then :-) )

And kudos to them for releasing the source!

"some software vendors use the embedded-null registry key technique
as a way to enforce the software license agreement and to reduce the

And of course there's all that splendid malware.

Embedded nulls should work just fine. The case that doesn't work is
string values that aren't properly null-terminated.

It would work, but this can't be changed now, the file format needs to
remain backwards compatible.

It turns out that it's fairly easy to use hex format only for
non-terminated strings, I put in a fix.

Got reminded but by the WWN that i wanted to send the numbers of authors.

$ for y in `seq 2002 2007`; do
    echo -n "Number of authors in $y: "
    git shortlog -s --since="$y-01-01 00:00" --until="$y-12-31 24:00" |
        wc -l
done

Number of authors in 2002: 185
Number of authors in 2003: 167
Number of authors in 2004: 183
Number of authors in 2005: 212
Number of authors in 2006: 195
Number of authors in 2007: 218

Well at least some of the code they created can be used to do something 
and help the project, and how knows, maybe one of them may join Wine and 
help.

Yes I almost forgot about the soc code, any ideas when will that code 
start being used in wine?

And thanks Alky, why not help wine?  ;)

D3DTA_TEXTURE has a somewhat strange behavior. If no texture is set, it 
behaves like D3DTA_PREVIOUS. Perhaps for alphaarg it behaves similarly if 
there is a texture, but it has no alpha. If that is the case, then I think it 
matches what you need for D3DTBLEND_MODULATE. Otherwise I think a private 
value like your D3DTOP_DX6MODULATE is the only way.

So I'd say test how D3DTA_TEXTURE should behave, maybe we implement it 
incorrectly at the moment.

I think the consent was to create one directory for each version, and make all 
but the newest wrap to the newest dll or d3dx8. This can be done via 
the .spec file, so no thunks have to be coded. If there are version 
differences, then we can implement them in the specific DLLs

Hi Austin,

-        case 0x32: /* ENABLE/DISABLE VIDEO ADDRERSSING */
+        case 0x32: /* ENABLE/DISABLE VIDEO ADDRRESSING */

That's still misspelled.

- * special virtualalloc, allocates lineary monoton growing memory.
+ * special virtualalloc, allocates linear monoton growing memory.


Monoton isn't a word.  Monotone is, as is monotonic, and
monotonically, which is probably what's meant.

-/* Volume functions derived from Alsaplayer source */
+/* Volume functions derivated from Alsaplayer source */

This change doesn't look correct to me.

Thanks for catching that/these. After looking at all these
misspellings, some of the incorrect start to look correct. I've got a
replacement patch ready, this time triple checked :-).

I changed it to monotonically. I wasn't sure what it meant, I was
correcting linear.

There was one correct and one incorrect spelling. I apparently
switched around my find and replace on that one. I fixed this as well.

I'm sending a replacement patch now. Sorry for the mistake. I'll be
more careful in the future.

A few issues:

1.
  *          DPMI_xalloc
- * special virtualalloc, allocates lineary monoton growing memory.
+ * special virtualalloc, allocates linear monoton growing memory.

Um... Probably should be 'linearly'.
But if you're opening the can of worms, might as well really
improve it.  I suspect this would be better:

  *          DPMI_xalloc
- * special virtualalloc, allocates lineary monoton growing memory.
+ * Try to VirtualAlloc the len bytes just past the last block we allocated
+ * If that's not available, try 64K beyond; if still not available, fail.

2.

-/* Volume functions derived from Alsaplayer source */
+/* Volume functions derivated from Alsaplayer source */

What?  What's wrong with "derived"?  "Derivated" isn't even a word?!

3.
-# include <unistd.h>
+#include <unistd.h>

That's not a spelling fix, and you would have to fix a whole
lot of those.  Best leave alone.

But what good is a malware study tool if the malware can trivially 
detect it's there? What if it doesn't infect the machine, but just run 
differently?

There are Windows tools that do similar things to what you need (check 
out the sys-internals web site), where the environment is much more 
close to the real thing.

Actually, Dan's question is the more interesting here - did the malwares 
work under wine?

I think it can be done without changing every string to hex.
How about adding \0 at the end of every null terminated sting,
and \0\0 at the end of proper REG_MULTI_SZ value which should
end with an empty string?

I might try to do that.

Is it possible to use a format like:

    Message="Hello"

[using the quotes to determine the start/end of the string - this
would require processing on the string data, though]

or

    Message=(5)Hello

[encoding the length in the stored data - this does not need any
processing, and counts any nulls if there are any]

I know it, but we can control all actions that the malware make. If the malware
bypass the protection and infect the machine... no problem, format, image and

I know that in windows we can found similar things, but with wine we can make a
first check, make a simple report, and send it to client.
Later, we can make a good manual analysis.

At the moment we can report quickly if a malware delete files, change registry...

"did the malwares work under wine?"
a lot of, :)

Think... if we dont get results, we must made a manual analysis...

Just using the TEXT macro is not good enough because it does not work 
on Unix. Check out the definition of STATUSCLASSNAMEA in commctrl.h for 
how this should be handled.

Why are you changing 'signalling' to 'signaling' in one place, but 
leaving it as is twice two lines down. Note that I'm not sure which form 
is right, but ispell is happy with both so it's possible both are ok.

Ispell caught steroscopic, and while investigating that, I corrected
signaling. I didn't notice the line below at the time.

Hold off the this patch Alexandre. It's apparently controversial,
since people don't like the whitespace change(s). If you want to apply
certain chunks feel free, otherwise, I'll get a less controversial
patch ready.

Just so I know, are we going with American or British English? There's
a lot of inconsistency, though the majority seems to be American...

I think there's a weak preference for American spelling, but I don't
see much reason to "correct" spelling from British to American
English.

We're not standardising on either, that is, both spellings should be 
considered valid. Any other course of action will only bring about 
flamewars.

IMO, the ok() tests in the child process are a bad idea (they won't be 
counted, nor returned as errors, by the parent process)
all the tests should be done in parent, see kernel32/tests/process.c for 
some example on how to do it properly

Wouldn't it be better to differ between the desktop and the Go versions?
Dunno if some games use the information that the Go versions are 
less-featured than the desktop versions, but might get us useful.

I'm seeing quite a few abbreviations. While they don't hurt anything,
they do give the code a slang tone. I personally think that wine is a
very professional project, and it's code should reflect that. While
this is obviously a very generic question, I wanted to clarify before
submitting some changes for these.

A few examples. These are all in comments, not in actual code, and I'm
checking to make sure compilation/tests still pass before submitting.
mem -> memory
init -> initialize
concat -> concatenate
nr/num -> number
infos -> information
manuf -> manufacturer

Etc. Anyone have any objections to these being changed? Call me a
grammar nazi, but it's easier to read when not shortened like that.

The only difference between the 7300go and the standard are the gpu clocks. The 7400go runs at the same gpu clock as the standard 7300, the 7300go runs at 100MHz less (at 350MHz instead of 450MHz). I would prefer to default to the non-go variant as well. And even consider merging the 7300 and 7400 detection and let that default to 7300 as both are the same. (a 7400go runs at the gpu clock of a desktop 7300 and there is no desktop 7400)

I object.  They're perfectly readable as abbreviations.  We try to
have as few style rules as possible, and not allowing abbreviations
goes too far.

I also object to removing abbreviations or Britishisms.

The key to being a successful spelling policeman
is to stick to noncontroversial spelling fixes,
and avoiding anything controversial or non-spelling-related.

No they aren't easier to read quite the contrary. They are part of the
normal jargon and easier to read/write; especially for non native
English speakers aka developers.

Oh, and removing words like "suck", "damn" (too bad "fuck" is missing)
and other swear words isn't a good idea either.

I ran a little test, it didn't show any differences in Wine or XP in such case 
(D3DTA_TEXTURE alpha selected and no alpha in texture pixelformat). This seems 
to give alpha=1.0. I found nothing on this at msdn, but it more or less makes 
sense (no alpha = opaque image). Do you think there would be any use in adding 
such test to ddraw/tests/visual.c?

I am a long time programmer and expect the include to be next to the # 
sign.  However, you are correct in that it does not break code, and if 
it is not broken, why fix?  Is it possible to indent the entire line by 
two spaces (I think it is not)?

Message-ID: <47844398.6020306@mcbride.name>


This is an announcement for a new release of the Dynace Object
Oriented Extension to C and the Windows Development System.

Real briefly, Dynace is an OO extension to C which includes multiple
inheritance, meta object protocol (MOP), class library, native thread
support, garbage collection, and is well documented.  The system has
been in production use for over 10 years.

The Windows Development System is a Dynace class library which makes
programming GUI applications under Windows and Linux (WINE) very easy.
It also includes a library for SQL Databases, an interface to Java and
MzScheme, a custom resource editor, etc.

Besides 600+ pages of professional documentation, the system also
includes a language tutorial and a GUI and Database tutorial.

Dynace will run on almost anything with a C compiler.  It has been
tested on many different systems over the years.

The Windows Development System runs on Windows an Linux (with WINE).  This
is open source software.

This has nothing to do with window stations, so it doesn't belong in

Why isn't it possible to forward the functions of the other dlls to the d3dx8 ones?
Or is this just for keeping the code clean so that we don't have mixed d3dx8 and d3dx9_36 forwardings?

You can of course forward to d3dx8 if they are compatible, why not?

Probably not. I know there are (ancient) C compilers that will bark
when the # is not the first character in a line as the preprocessor
will then not see it as a valid preprocessor line and simply ignore
it.

Subject: Advapi32: Service Control RPC 
Message-ID: <001701c852f2$c7976450$4001a8c0@NATERS>

The current service control API directly accesses the registry for most
things.
In native those fucntions are simple wrappers around RPC calls to the actual
service.exe application. Mikolaj Zalewski offered about 3 months ago a
possible
aproach to implement the service.exe program.

In there the proxy code generated through widl directly calls various RPC
functions
to communicate with the service manager executable. When doing some tests
with native
advapi32 under Wine I found that those fucntions seem to be implemented by
simply
calling more or less directly NdrCallClient2. Widl obviously doesn't
generate code
yet using this API and I'm sure wire compatibility can be achieved without
using
NdrCallClient2.

But a few questions that came up here:
- How good or complete is Wine's NdrCallClient(2) implementation? Would it
be feasable
  to use it for the implementation of the service rpc calls?
- Assuming it would be not a whole lot of work to make NdrCallClient(2) work
for this,
  would it be desirable to use this API instead of the code generated by
widl currently
  from complexity and/or performance view?
- Of course this would mean that widl would have to support (some of) the
{Oi | Oic | Oif | Oicf}
  flags to generate the proxy code but as it seems the necessary code
generator at least
  for the client side would be fairly trivial as it is mostly just a wrapper
around
  NdrClientCall(2) and most of the nitty gritty work is done in in that
function.
  A midl generated proxy code using -Oicf looks at least quite trivial. 

Any opinions about this anyone?

Yes, we need to dig that out again. I forget what was blocking it being 
committed.

Exactly. The whole point of IDL in DCE/RPC is that it is independent of 
the DCE/RPC implementation as long as the generated code conforms to the 
NDR rules. With Microsoft's implementation, most of the NDR rules are 
implemented in rpcrt4 and all the IDL compiler as to do is output code 
to call the buffer size, marshall, unmarshall and free functions in the 
right order. widl should be correct in this respect. (There are some 
shortcuts that midl/widl take for marshalling base types and the 
alignments would have to be correct for these, but these are simple to 
get right.)

There is no reason to use NdrClientCall2 for any purpose in Wine.

> But a few questions that came up here:

Pretty good, IMHO. We use exactly the code that's in Wine here at 
CodeWeavers for connecting to Exchange servers (the RPC code is 
MIDL-compiled code in DLLs used by Outlook).

No. Everything (except multi-dimensional arrays, possibly) can already 
be done by the code we output already. Adding code to output -Oicf proc 
format strings in widl would be possible, but unnecessary.

It also adds problems because gcc and MSVC have differing opinions on 
how to return unions from functions. For this reason, we have 
implemented NdrClientCall2 in Wine by pretending it returns a LONG_PTR 
instead. widl would have to decide on whether it wanted to be compatible 
with our signature of the function or the MS one.

It reduces code size (and on modern processors that is supposed to lead 
to performance gains), but that is the only advantage that it gives us.

He's translating it to Gerenglish. Maybe we should get a native speaker to do

Not easily. Mr. Bugs is set as a globalwatcher in the main prefs.

'globalwatchers'
     A comma-separated list of users who should receive a copy of every 
notification mail the system sends.

One way I see fixing this is to remove Mr. Bugs from the globalwatchers 
and log in as him and check all the types of mail we want him to 
receive. This is how we used to do it before the globalwatchers option 
was added. I'm not really sure of the ramifications of doing this.

Hi Ge, sorry I missed this.  I have some stylistic quibbles with your patch:

perhaps, but please be consistent.

But even fixing this, I think it'd be clearer to do something like the
following:

-     if (hToken != NULL && hToken != (HANDLE)-1)
+     if (hToken != NULL && hToken != (HANDLE)-1 &&
!_IsCurrentUserToken(hToken))

That is, make a function that checks whether the token represents the
current user, and returns TRUE if so/FALSE if not.

If I recall correctly, it was changed to globalwatcher because wine-bugs
wouldn't receive a copy of bug changes any more if the bug wasn't
assigned to him and you didn't explictly add him to cc.

Ah.  OK, can we put in some ad hoc filtering there to
remove just a few noisy sources of emails?

This is likely related to the extra security changes added to
/etc/sysctl.conf (vm.mmap_min_addr = 65536).  As a work-around, set this
to 0.  Hopefully wine can be built in a way that it doesn't have to
reserve the lower 64k all the time.

Hi,
As it was in David Adam's patch case, here also you are forwarding  
d3dx8.D3DXVec3Normalize as D3DXVec2Normalize.
I think it's a typo and strikes me so much because it's a first line of  
the specfile.
I'm new to Wine, so please correct me if I'm wrong.

I'm myself not exactly sure what the reasons where. It looks pretty ok
to me except that the way it is now with no real parameter verification
in the API function itself anymore before calling into the proxy stub,
the test framework will cause various debugger breaks because of the
RpcRaiseExceptions() in the proxy stubs. Also Mikolaj himself mentioned
at one point that this is not ready for commitment yet and I guess that
might influence Alexandre's decision quite a bit :-)

Ok, but I have made some parameter protocols to NdrClientCall2
from native advapi32 and believe that using those MIDL format
informations could allow to make an idl file that would result
in a fully wire compatible protocol to the MS services.exe one.
It's not exactly trivial to decode the MIDL_ProcFormatString
but by verifying the generated MIDL generated code against those
protocolled parameters would certainly help a lot. A first not
through check seems to indicate that almost every service control
API has its own services.exe rpc message, so no ANSII to Widechar
translation in the Advapi32.dll! Probably because there was a
services.exe implementation before the widechar APIs got introduced.
Also the protocol message numbers seem to have some holes, probably
some undocumented APIs here.

Isn't te difference with structs too?

Ok I let it at the way widl generates the svcctl code for now.
It's not like that code generates MBs of code and if widl is
good enough for most datatypes already then let it work that
way. It's also possible that the performance gain by the smaller
code is compensated by the more direct Ndr routine calls compared
to NdrClientCall(2) which has to marshall the data entirely based
on its own runtime type format parsing.

Agreed, but there's another occurrence of this check in msvcrt_argvtos
which has been there all along. Did Coverity spot that one too?

We really don't want to do development in that way. It would be much 
better to use the information that Samba have gained in a clean way 
combined with documentation with the equivalent Win32 function to figure 
out the compatible IDL file.

This kind of work has already been done and the interface fairly well 
documented, so I'll point you at this documentation:

Yes, but way down the list. I am usually just looking at the latest
entries ;)

Subject: Please change Bugzilla email settings for wine-bugs
Message-ID: <12339.30792.qm@web26011.mail.ukl.yahoo.com>

Whilst on the subject of Bugzilla email settings, is
it possible to add a message to Bugzilla emails asking
users not to reply, but to post in Bugzilla?

There's now often up to 5 replies a day sent directly
to wine-bugs at winehq.org, instead of being posted in
Bugzilla.

Thanks,

Luke

Please stop resending that big patch again and again, it's not going in,
it's full of problems. You need to provide correct forwards for all
functions instead of stubs, and the functions need to match the Windows
ones, you can't just copy the same spec file 12 times. Also the code was
written by David, you have to use his name in the changelog, and you
shouldn't add your copyright in all the files unless you make
significant changes.

That's ugly, please get rid of that macro.

Subject: major regression in current git

Hi,

Sorry I've not filed a bug report for this or dug in to it more, I am
a little short on time. I've got a clean tree and am trying to install
Office 97 and it seems to have totally regressed. A clean build from a
few days ago installed flawlessly. I've made clean and reconfigured
twice now and still see this behavior. System is ubuntu 7.10

wine: Unhandled page fault on read access to 0x00000000 at address

You could simply remove the wildcard from the end of string after
FindFirstFile, no need to copy the whole string.

Subject: Indentation
Message-ID: <6514eb960801100623u670003ccj7182907f99ff65aa@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

What is the preferred number of spaces of indentation? In
comdlg32/colordlg.c it is either one or three spaces and there are a
few places where there is no indentation and where things are randomly
indented or switches between amounts of indentation.

What is the policy on when to change indentation and other things like
turning something like this:

    if (condition)
    {
        ...some code...
        return 0;
    }
    return 1;

into

    if (condition)
        return 1;

    ...some code...
    return 0;

The page on style
(http://www.winehq.org/site/docs/winedev-guide/style-notes) only
contains very little on coding style.

Another question, would it be OK to use smooth gradients in the colour
dialog? It could be slow on older computer accessing each pixel
individually although the code is only run on startup.

Some of wine's code is a mess with indentation, but alexandre won't
commit indentation patches.
This basically means that if there are multiple styles of indentations
in the same file, you have to pick the one that is around the place
where you put your function, although secretly when Alexandre isn't
looking I sometimes pick the preferred '4 spaces' one.

Explicit patches that only do that are not accepted as far as I know,
because it introduces bugs as you just skillfully demonstrated. ;-)

However if you are rewriting the function you might end up doing that
simplication in the process.

Cheers,
Maarten

Oops, I was thinking about inversing the condition while I was writing it :)
- if (condition)
+ if (!condition)

What about if I change one line or add a line in a small function
(approximately 15 lines). Will I be allowed to change the indentation
or do that simplification above? The one line indentation makes it
difficult to see the code structure sometimes and I also prefer the 4
spaces one.

Okay, I now have spent some time on analysing the differences of the dlls
(at least regarding to what functions they provide). So just a few questions
from my side to make sure the next version of the patch will be what you expect:
1. Really just to ensure that one: You DO want me to forward even the stubbed
functions to the "d3dx9_36 stubs", don't you? If there's more to the forwards,
then tell me please.
2. Regarding the copyright thing, I'm really sorry for ignoring David's copyright, I'll
change that back. However, you didn't mean the git changelog with
"use his name in the changelog", did you?
Well, if you did, It'd be possible to mention both, as I'll have rewritten all
the specfiles. (It's not that I wouldn't respect David for his work, but the
time I spent on this shouldn't be left out either)
3. When it's ready, should I post my patch to a pastebin and ask at #winehackers
first if it's ok like that?
4. Is there anything other that I should correct?

All functions that can be forwarded must be forwarded, you don't want to
have to go back and fix 12 spec files every time one is implemented. If
some functions are not compatible then of course they shouldn't be
forwarded. You need to verify this for each function.

If you have really rewritten them, then of course they are copyright by
you. If all you did is s/d3dx8/d3dx9_36/ (as seems likely since you have
the exact same bugs) then David should be credited for them.

> 3. When it's ready, should I post my patch to a pastebin and ask at #winehackers

Yes, and then you should submit first a standalone d3dx9_36, and once
this is applied, a single other dll like d3dx9_24, and not worry about
the other ones until you can get that one in.

I haven't tried doing serial I/O with it, but it installs
and starts fine.  If somebody who's into serial I/O could
give it a spin, it might turn up some problems.
(Or maybe they were just using an old version of wine, who knows.)

Does anyone use gdb attach to debug pthread winelib applications? I've had a
lot of problems with winedbg and winedbg --gdb, but have gdb attach working
well except I can't debug threads.  Breakpoints in threads crash the app and
I have no thread info.

gdb attach works fine with non-winelib pthread test cases.

Subject: Dereference of null ptrs after an ERR has been executed
Message-ID: <47873A39.2050806@yless4u.com.au>

What is the policy for handling the dereferencing of pointers that have 
previously been determined to be NULL and an ERR message has been 
issued.  It seems that there are many cases where Coverity has found 
that the test is made but the code falls through to the dereference.  In 
a number of cases to a TRACE.  Are we trying to throw an exception in 
these cases but assuming that the problem is unlikely and not worth 
further handling.  Essentially, it seems that if this is the policy then 
we can mark the Coverity entries as ignore.  In some cases it seems that 
the only problem may be the TRACE and there is no other reference which 
implies that an else may solve the problem ie.

if (!ptr) ERR "msg"
else TRACE

The other solution is to get the Coverity people to recognise the 
circumstance and not report it.

It doesn't make sense to check an RVA against PointerToRawData.

Oh, yes. I need more coffee :) And I should have been test native -
native doesn't even bother to search section unless it is file mapping
(MSDN is at least not complete, as usual). I'll send new version shortly.

That or we could modify the TRACE to use wine_dbgstr_[aw](ptr).

That sort of code doesn't make much sense. Either a null pointer is
valid input and it should be handled properly, or it isn't and there's
no point in having an ERR, we might as well crash and get a full
backtrace.

This will probably give some fallout ;)

I wanted to write earlier, but did forget about it over the last
days.

For my grown Wine installation this now starts:

- 2 instances of a Windows Worm
- Google Talk (not working)
- Skype (crashing)
- pccam.exe from some digital camera disk
- the annoying Steam.exe auto-update and ask-for-subscription dialog
- perhaps more

and this even on "make check" :(

We probably need some tool to edit Run and RunOnce entries now.

Works as it is supposed to then :-)

I agree it is a pain with "make test" though, and some way to easilly edit

Id say so, a one stop place for anything that has a chance to get
executed on startup:

* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunServices
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunServicesOnce
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\ RunOnce\Setup
above are listed from http://support.microsoft.com/kb/137367
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnceEx
* HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
* HKEY_USERS\.DEFAULT\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\RunOnce
* HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Software\Microsoft\Windows
NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon\Userinit
* HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Software\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Windows
* autoexec.bat
* config.sys
* startup folder
* system.ini


Any other areas that windows uses to launch programs when starting up?

Agreed, and be able to disable them entirely, I have a program that
crashes during autorun, so my virtual wine desktop wouldn't close even
with nothing visible.

wine regedit

Maybe it would be a good idea to have an option to make us of this new
feature...

Subject: Sibelius Scorch Setup Problem.
Message-ID: <4787D6D1.8040408@blueyonder.co.uk>

Trying to install this software 
(http://www.musicnotes.com/download/SetupScorchNS.exe) to display music 
scores I get the following problem.  After the initial dialog, another 
dialog is displayed for a fraction of a second then the installer 
crashes with the output below.  Is this a wine problem ?  Ijust 
downloaded and installed the latest (0.9.53) version.

I've found Mike Lin's Startup Control Panel
(http://mlin.net/StartupCPL.shtml) very useful for this on windows. It
appears to work on Wine, though I don't seem to have any Run or
RunOnce entries so can't be sure.

Running the tests now hangs for me waiting

Is that something we want to fix, or should
I just do 'winetricks gecko' before starting the tests?

Message-ID: <a71bd89a0801120018w111f4714j33d14917efd639e6@mail.gmail.com>

Seeing as we have about 45 open riched20 bugs,
and some recent regressions, I figured it'd be
useful to add riched20 to winetricks.

Incidentally, since I lost the workstation that had
the old rcs repository it was in, I gave in to modern
times and put it in a new repository at
  http://code.google.com/p/winezeug/
- Dan

p.s. I have a backlog of two or three big updates,
one from Lei for codecs, and another from
Andrea Bocci for all sorts of things.
I'd merge them now but I have to go read another
Discworld book... they're like crack...

Message-ID: <a71bd89a0801120039o3d6a1802n5b05ce498f3e43b2@mail.gmail.com>

Since Vijay suggested doing a bug audit two weeks ago,
the number of open bugs has dropped by about 300, or 10%:
http://bugs.winehq.org/reports.cgi?product=-All-&datasets=NEW%3A&datasets=UNCONFIRMED%3A
That was quite a burst of activity!

There are still 1800 bugs that haven't been touched in
over 90 days (137 of them reported by me, alas),
so we have a lot of auditing and retesting left to do.

BTW, James Hawkins suggests that we consider bugs abandoned
if the reporter doesn't respond within 90 days
(we had, I think, been letting them sit longer),
which seems reasonable to me.

We might want to add an option for only executing these on wineboot.
Hell, we might want to make this the default unless the user has a new
Wine installation made with wineprefixcreate.

As it is, this change might break things.

Yes, the templates for the emails are in git with the rest of
bugzilla. We just need to be carefull to not throw off anything
that parses these mails. Patches welcome.

We could change that mailinglist to not accept mail from anything

Please don't filter the mail sent to wine-bugs (it also serves as
a complete backup and change tracker of the bugzilla). However it
should be easy to filter the mail you receive: There is a
X-Bugzilla-Changed-Fields header in mails from bugzilla which
contains only "CC" if that was the only field changed. The
problem is that there is no header for an added comment so you
would not want to throw away messages that contain "--- Comment"
at the beginning of a line in the body.

I know it can easily take a month for me to reply to a bug,
especially when it requires testing to determine the content of
my reply. Bug reports that are waiting for a reply can be flagged
as such and thus can be filtered and thus they shouldn't bother
anyone.

I agree. Neither should such a bug be flagged "Abandoned?" or
resolved abandoned.

..also, a very good utility to handle the autorun stuff is autoruns.exe from the Sysinternals Suite.
Actually, the whole suite is a very good testbed for wine as it contains low level monitoring tools
like Diskmon.exe, Filemon.exe, Tcpview.exe, procexp.exe, portmon.exe, Winobj.exe.. many of those
fail on module:NtLoadDriver stub but some like process explorer or the autoruns tool work almost
perfectly fine. Running the splendid bluescreen screensaver would be totally awesome too, but that
needs native ntoskrnl.exe to fetch the bootlogo..
by the way yes, sysinternals has been bought by M$ mid 2006, and of course the first thing they did
is introduce a nasty legal pop-up to all of the utils, but having a short look at it we should be
fine using it to debug WiNE ;)

	Patches with whitespace changes only are unlikely to be accepted and patches 
with tabs probably will not be accepted too. Therefore I suggest to fix 
formatting in your main patches themselves instead of fixing this with 
additional patch.

It is configured to do just that; so the emails just
end up in the list moderation queue, which
(presumably?) is only seen by me.  I've been posting
people's replies in Bugzilla myself, so they don't get
lost forever.

What are the tab settings in your editor? All white space in your

Until someone comes up with the addition to winecfg to edit the Run and
RunOnce keys (and it really seems like that is what we need), we should
probably detect if those keys have changed and pop up a dialog on the next
wineboot that says: "The Run or RunOnce registry keys have changed, probably
because you installed a new application.  We're now going to execute them,
but be prepared for something to explode and steal your lunch money.  You
can repair anything broken by running "wine regedit" and editing
HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run"

Winecfg is not really the place for it. Windows power users expect to
have msconfig....its a shame we can't lift the one from ReactOS
because they have a working LGPL replacement.

OK, new winetricks up, with new packages
  vcrun2005sp1
  vcrun2008
  xvid
  ffdshow
and new pseudopackages
  allfonts
  allvcodecs
It no longer picks a particular sourceforge mirror, which
should help folks who don't live near Los Angeles.
And mono12 is updated to mono-1.2.6.

As always, the new winetricks is online at

Since the follwoning functions are not  implemented in the MS

SetSize, CopyTo, Commit, Revert, LockRegion, UnlockRegion, and Clone

They should be TRACE and not ERR.

Message-ID: <781397410801122119s5f5d3e48h7e2d0890242f16be@mail.gmail.com>

I am looking to fix a bug causing serial ports to not show up in some
applications. The problem is due to missing registry entries for the
serial ports. I know what entries need to be created but I don't think
they should go in wine.inf. They should get created dynamically,
preferably on each run, based on what currently exists in
.wine/dosdevices/

The bug I am working on is 9902 (http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9902).

Does anyone have any insight on where I should start looking to
implement this? Implementation suggestions? In the bug, Juan Lang made
the suggestion that "Explorer's hal.c should be extended to create new
devices for all the ports it finds, using SetupDiCreateDeviceInfo
followed by SetupDiRegisterDeviceInfo. For some devices it should also
call SetupDiCreateDeviceInterface to register a particular interface."
I've looked in programs/explorer/hal.c and I am not sure where to
begin hooking something like that in.

It was also suggested in #winehackers that this could go in the same
place that other hardware like disk drives are detected and
configured. I am not sure where that would be either or if that is the
same as hal.c.

I am new to wine development to please feel free to over explain.

Thanks,

The general policy is to no longer accept code from ReactOS though the
Wine taskmgr and registry editor were developed by ReactOS developers.
It should be obvious that its cleanly implemented so I don't know if
there is any way Alexandre would make an exception to import it. There
is really nothing to be reversed from this tool and Colin's version is
under the correct license so I don't see any reason why it should be
rejected. Its not like its some low level library without
documentation or anything. If we can't merge it due to policy then I
think taskmgr and regedit should be remove from Winehq git.

I don't see why winecfg can't have a page similar to what msconfig has.
It not hard to add it to winecfg, there is nothing magic in the reactos
version.

This is true. I am just saying most windows power uses expect msconfig
to be there these days. We could have a dummy msconfig thats just a
wrapper and invokes winecfg on the correct page. Being as we don't
follow the design windows power users expect by having CPL applets and
the like, it would make sense to stick it in winecfg with everything
else I guess...

My impression was that Wine follows the requests and demands of Linux
(and other supported OSes) users, not the Windows' ones regardless of
their powerfulness.

Because git is unstable on the Mac platform, I've been utilizing a 
little time investigating the use of either SVN or CVS to download .git 
updates.  This appears to not be working per the Wiki pages for SVN. 

Is CVS or SVN still being supported for Wine or is git the only 
supported download (I don't expect to do any patching for now) method 
for .git updates?

Thank you.

Well most Windows power users are used to a graphical registry editor
where Wine supports a text registry and we all know how much Linux
users love flat text file manipulation. Perhaps we should revert the
graphical registry editor for this and reasons I mentioned in the
prior email....

There are quite a few installers that use RunOnce to get around file
locking, but I still haven't had to use one fortunately. As I said, as
long as I can disable it. RunOnce wouldn't even have to be disabled,
I'd be happy with a "RunOnce wants to execute 'foo.exe blipp blopp',
'No, and clear it from registry', 'Sure' ".

I'd like to know where and when SetupDiRegisterDeviceInfo gets called on
Windows. I know that Alexandre is planning to move drive detection from
explorer to mountmgr.sys, serial devices will probably end up in serial.sys
or something like that. Perhaps this could work by making the driver itself
do device registration.

	I see no reason to revert currently abailable tools without *really good* 
technical or legal reason. Sorry but this would be simply... not smart, 
really.
	I like the ability to edit registry directly with text editor but this 
doesn't mean that I don't need GUI tool for that. Reasons are simple: with 
GUI I have tree with registry keys and with plain text I have sequence of 
registry keys. I think it is obvious why one would prefer tree instead of 
sequence in some cases and sequence instead of tree in other cases.
	BTW, msconfig isn't very popular tool. Just compare how many Windows users 
have used regedit and how many have used msconfig (and how freqently it is 
used in comparison with regedit). And of course many Linux users simply don't 
know about it. This means that even if we include msconfig its use will not 
be as intuitive as winecfg use for purpose of editing startup keys. Therefore 
winecfg is better for that purpose. In fact, use of winecfg will be obvious 
for all WINE users - including Windows power users.
	If we can include msconfig - good, but in my opinion its inclusion doesn't 
mean that winecfg shouldn't support editing of startup keys. Therefore, its 
inclusion or rejection isn't important to WINE Project (in other words, this 
is minor issue). As I said, winecfg is more convenient and intuitive for that 
purpose.

	If you disagree with WINE policy related to ReactOS you need to talk to AJ 
directly (for example, on IRC channel).  Multiple requests to exclude existing 
tools on wine-devel without good reasons will not help to make WINE or its 
current policy better, really.

Because it was asked:

We have to move all (including closed) bugs from a component into
others to remove that component. If an component is not empty
when it's removed all it's bugs also get removed.

But there is also the possibility to just leave obsolete
components around forever.

_obsoletet_help is a component. Should we perhaps add a keyword
"helpapis"?

No, the winhelp API is in user32 and winhelp.exe is under programs.
We do need an hhctrl.ocx component though.

I've switched the components to unknown on the following components,
so they can be removed:

console
directx-dshow
help
ipc
ports
resources

These are the counts of the remaining obsolete components:

binary - 1193
directx - 375
files - 137
gui - 358
multimedia - 139
winelib - 143

I'll correct these components at a rate of about 100 a day so as not
to spam the list too much.

I'd agree to that, but we could also do it at installer runtime, i.e. we check
in the Windows SetRegistryKey function(don't know the real name) if the key is
autostart related, interupt the installer program and ask the user if he
wants to allow that. The method of asking the user at RunOnce has IMO
the disadvantage that the user may not know what installer added
the RunOnce entry anymore (because it's a couple of days ago that the
last Wine instance was running or so).

The policy regarding ReactOS is not going to change and I really don't
care at this point. My point in reply to Dmitry's comment was while I
agree using winecfg for msconfig functionality is fine I was just
using a reductio ad-absurdum to point out that if we are not going to
make a wrapper program for msconfig for power windows users that are
used to certain windows functionality because we don't care about them
and the windows way of doing things, then why should we care about
windows power users ablity to graphically edit the registry? In
regedits case there would be two fold argument for removing it, 1.
Because it was contributed by ReactOS developers and 2. Because we
obviously don't care about whats convenient to people coming from a
windows background using that logic.

	Because it is important for MOST Linux users who use WINE. Of course some 
users use regedit rarely, some frequently - but fact is that they are using 
it. For example, I use it but I know very little about Windows.
	Most users will expect ability to edit startup keys in winecfg. And rest of 
users who didn't expect it to be there will learn about it very quickly - as 
soon as they run winecfg at least once.
	As I have already said, use of winecfg will be intuitive for both Linux and 
Windows power users. I simply see no problem here.
	I'm sure that there will be very little number of users who would use 
something else instead of winecfg when winecfg will have a tab for 
configurion startup keys.

> Because we

	"We shouldn't care about Windows power users" != "we shouldn't care 
about Linux users". Please note that I say nothing here about should we care 
about Windows (power) users or not. I'm just pointing that your logic isn't 
correct.
	I try to explain why. First of all, msconfig and regedit cannot be compared 
like two utilities of same importance or like two programs intended for same 
audience.
	regedit is extremely popular, its use is intuitive for most Linux users, and 
it cannot be replaced with a tab in winecfg. It even cannot be replaced with 
external Linux tools like text editor because wineserver will overwrite any 
changes that was made by an external program (this is true of course only if 
wineserver was running; you need to shutdown it before using external program 
for registry editing).
	msconfig is mostly intended for Window power users, its use isn't intuitive 
for most Linux users (in fact, it even isn't intuitive for most Windows users 
too), and it can be replaced with a tab in winecfg (at least, its most 
important functionality).
	As you can see, there is a big difference. It is incorrect to ignore 
importance of regedit for Linux users. Why? Because if msconfig was very 
important then it (or at least its simplified replacement) can be even 
written from scratch. This is true for regedit but isn't true for msconfig.  
In other words, it is unlikely that someone will write it from scratch in 
near future because of very low demand; but if WINE will lack regedit utility 
it is very likely that someone will write it from scratch if necessary.
	That just means regedit is important not only for Windows power users but for 
most of WINE users (including simple Linux users who are using WINE).

On my machine, we've been hovering between
five and ten test suite failures for some time
(see http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=9916 )

IMHO one of the hallmarks of 1.0 should be reliably
getting zero test suite failures.
That would make regressions stand out like sore thumbs
instead of requiring developers to diff results
before and after their changes, and might
result in fewer regressions getting committed.

How 'bout folks spend some time tracking
the current six odd failures down and cleaning them up?

L. Rahyen:

I have found that I CANNOT contribute code to this project.  However, 
this does not stop me from contributing my USD .02. 

Regedit serves a single purpose, editing the registry.  msconfig serves 
the purpose of editing the configuration of Windows and as a Windows 
'hacker' I live on this program.  Of course, for simplicity's sake this 
can be a tab in winecfg, but for a Windows user/hacker moving to 
Linux/Wine adding a symlink to winecfg and the appropriate tab would be 
acceptable, but overlooking this requirement is not 'a good thing'.  And 
adding the suprise of running Run Aways and Run Once is not nice.  A 
warning in the announcement would be nice and almost necessary for those 
folks running a combination Windows/Linux box, like I used to.  This was 
to overcome the massive number of Windows 'friends' like Storm.  So, I 
would implore the investigation of adding the necessary parts of 
msconfig to winecfg and before the actual release of Wine 1.0.

BTW, regedit is an absolute necessity to the Wine project, but it is 
also a very dangerous tool in the wrong hands.

Thank you.

Ron:

Where are you getting your git code from and does it require any patches 
to make it compile and run on MacOSX 10.4?

Reply off list if you feel that this is necessary.

Perhaps 'binary' could be automatically renamed to 'unknown' to avoid
too much of manual work? Others can be checked/renamed manually.

I was wondering the same thing.  The other components were short so I
went ahead and changed those, but it would be great if we could
"rename" the remaining components to unknown.

Sounds like a worthy goal IMO.  It seems theres much more than 5 or 6
things which need work though:
http://test.winehq.org/data/200801121000/   Perhaps we should try and
have the nightly suite also pass all tests -- or is this too much of a
frivolous goal?

Not a pretty picture, is it?
But I was only referring to the tests that fail on Wine; there,
we have control over both the test and the code, so if
we can't get those tests passing, we're pretty weak :-)

Getting all tests passing on Windows XP would be great,
but it's a lot of work.   It'd be less work if we focused on just the tests
that are failing on *all* Win XP systems, but that's still
at least 180 ok's that aren't ok.  Let's at least fix the 5 or 10 that are
failing on Wine, and try to keep them fixed.

Are these tests passing (now) on Alexandre's machine? I thought he didn't apply 
patches that break the wine tests? (at least on his box).

Why XP? Doesn't that mean our default should be XP as well?

	I agree that it would be great to add additional tools such as msconfig. If 
it would be added we can make a tab in winecfg (or button in intuitive place 
of winecfg) for just running it. This would be intuitive for all users.
	However as I said if we cannot include it there are "more or less" acceptable 
alternative way to solve the problem.
	Personally I prefer inclusion of msconfig and possibility to run it from 
winecfg (along with ability to run it directly as msconfig).

> And adding the suprise of running Run Aways and Run Once is not nice.

	Yeah, I remember how a lot of (mostly non-functional or partially functional) 
programs started automatically not only for me but also for my users (because 
of my multiuser setup).
	By itself this is useful feature. But lack of proper configuration tool in 
clean WINE is the real problem currently...

	This is certainly true.
