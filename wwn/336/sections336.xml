Picasa, Google's now famous iPhoto-style application now has a <a href="http://picasa.google.com/linux/download.html">new version</a> for Linux.  Picasa is notable because it runs on some native code, but mostly on windows binaries running with WINE.  From what i've read, its gotten some nice new features and is overall "<a href="http://blog.wired.com/monkeybites/2007/12/picasa-new-linu.html">snappy</a> " (from wired):

Google has released a beta preview of Picasa 2.7 for Linux adding web album integration, more editing features and better RAW support. The new beta still isn't a native app (much of its code comes from the Windows version and runs via the included Wine components), but it does run considerably faster and the web album features will be welcome news for Picasa Web users.
</p><p>
[...] Picasa's RAW support "just works" much better than any of the other options I've tried, and it remains (even as a beta) quite snappy and stable.</p>

So it has come to my attention that there have been several typos of the names of several prominent Winesman.  I'de like to apologize to Mr. Julliard in particular :).  Will make my best effort to not mess that up.  If you notice any such errors please do bring them to my attention.  </p></section>

<topic>Wine in the Market</topic>
<p>
I've started to hear and read things sounding something like "Runs <font style="text-decoration: line-through;">On Windows</font> with WINE".  Catchy, ain't it?  This was prompted by an <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com/node/1005911">article</a> in the <a href="http://www.linuxjournal.com">Linux Journal</a> recently.

As more musicians migrate from Windows to Linux we can expect greater demand for those users' Olde Favorites to run under Linux, either natively or in some other environment (emulation, virtualization). Though that migration is now only a mere trickle, it's been growing and will continue to grow. Some Windows-based audio software developers have already extended their marketing by positioning their programs as viable under <a href="http://www.winehq.com">Wine</a>.

Alexander Nicolaysen SÃ¸rnes has been rather diligent recently with a handful of user-visible AppDB Changes/Updates.  Some of which may be useful to some WWN readers:</p>

<topic>State of WINE</topic>
<p>

(Thanks Dan Kegel for the link).  The beloved leader of WINE, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexandre_Julliard">Alexandre Julliard</a>, was recently spotted in a <a href="http://www.lugradio.org/episodes/90">radio interview</a> with <a href="http://www.lugradio.org/">LugRadio</a>.  Its a 9 minute interview (starting from 2:02) which is fairly entertaining.  I'll be reading AJ's postes from now on with his accent in my head!  He talks a bit about Wine 1.0 (1 dot 0 as AJ says it), the state of WINE and its progress towards supporting new applications like Office 12 etc.  He also talks, in a very comical portion of the interview, about the quality of the Windows API:

<topic>History</topic>
<p>
Dan Kegel has done some research to find the early beginnings of WINE; to find where it all began.
</p>
<quote><p>
winehq.org doesn't seem to have a link to the message
that launched the wine project, so I went looking.
<br /><br />
The first message I found contemplating it was dated 1 Jun 1993,
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux/msg/0a7c3867abdb4a76">http://groups.google.com/group/comp.os.linux/msg/0a7c3867abdb4a76</a>
Is that about the right estimate for Wine's birthday?
<br /><br />
A roughly 1995 writeup about Wine is at
<a href="http://www.softlookup.com/tutorial/redhat/rhl58.asp">http://www.softlookup.com/tutorial/redhat/rhl58.asp</a>
It has a screen shot of a game Pipe Dream running under
Wine.  I just checked; the game is still online at

<a href="http://members.chello.at/theodor.lauppert/games/pipe1.htm">http://members.chello.at/theodor.lauppert/games/pipe1.htm</a>
and runs well on today's wine :-)

Austin English writes in with some more research:</p>
<quote><p>
I found this announcement from Bob Amstadt announcing the mailing
list, this was dated September 16, 1993:<br />
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.windows.x.i386unix/browse_thread/thread/ee272fa922314342/a08260429f730cdf">http://groups.google.com/group/comp.windows.x.i386unix/browse_thread/thread/ee272fa922314342/a08260429f730cdf</a>
<br /><br />
But according to this status report, it was started in early June 1993:<br />
<a href="http://groups.google.com/group/comp.windows.x.i386unix/browse_thread/thread/88fbd87c0ae2e48f/5003eb8ed33ae522">http://groups.google.com/group/comp.windows.x.i386unix/browse_thread/thread/88fbd87c0ae2e48f/5003eb8ed33ae522</a>
<br /><br />
Which makes your June 1, 1993 date sound about right :-). Looking a
bit further in that discussion, you can see Eric making a call for
volunteers the next day:<br />

Of course this thread wouldn't be complete without  Alexandre Julliard also reliving old memories:

The 0.0.2 release was on June 29, and 0.0.1 was about a week before
that IIRC. I don't have the exact date unfortunately.

Hehe, I remember spending lots of time playing, I mean testing that

I have a copy of iX Magazine (  <a href="http://www.heise.de/ix/">http://www.heise.de/ix/</a> ) from
July 1994 that has a four page write up about Wine. There is also
a full page interview, Q&amp;A with Bob Amstadt.

Our support for Photoshop 7 and maybe CS
is strong enough for industrial users --
and if it isn't, I'd like to know about it so
we can do something about it.<br />
So I posted notes asking for serious Photoshop
users to try it and let us know what's still broken:<br />
<a href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4001494">http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?p=4001494</a><br />
<a href="http://www.adobeforums.com/webx/.3c05a212">http://www.adobeforums.com/webx/.3c05a212</a><br />
Hopefully that will bring in some good bug reports.<br />

<p>I think its appropriate to re-publish his letter here:</p>
<quote><p>
Topic: Wine Project looking for Photoshop CS users who want Linux support
</p><p>
If you're not a Linux user, or if you don't like the idea of
running Photoshop for Windows on Linux, you can stop reading now,
this message probably won't be interesting to you.
</p><p>
The Wine project is looking for hardcore Photoshop CS or 7
users who use Photoshop professionally, all day, every day,
and who are willing to tell us why they can't do that in Linux
using Wine yet.
</p><p>
We know everybody would like Photoshop CS3 or at least
CS2 support, but support for CS2 and CS3 isn't quite
ready, so we'd like to focus on our strengths, and support
Photoshop 7 and CS excellently. Don't worry, we're also
working on the CS2 and CS3 issues. Getting all the 7 and CS
issues taken care of builds a stronger foundation for CS2 and CS3.
</p><p>
If something doesn't work in Photoshop 7 or CS itself,
or your favorite plugin works in Windows with 7 or CS
but not in Wine, please let us know how to reproduce
the problem. To do that, just reply to this post,
or post in the wine-users mailing list,
or leave a comment in the wine appdb for Photoshop 7 or CS,
or file a bug in the Wine Bugzilla,
whichever you're more comfortable with.
We'll take it from there; if we can reproduce it, we'll
file a bug and see if we can get a wine developer to fix it.
</p><p>
Ideally you'd test with the latest release of Wine
(currently 0.9.51), but if you're still on a slightly older
version, don't sweat it, we'll retest on the latest for you.
