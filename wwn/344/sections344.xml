CodeWeavers has announced their newest product, <a href="http://www.codeweavers.com/products/cxgames/">Crossover Games</a>.  Crossover games is a custom build of wine, along with a handful of proprietary modifications and gui additions to add solid support for a number of Windows games on Linux!  CodeWeavers' official blurb and launch games list:

<p>
Now gamers can play the games they want, on whatever platform they want! With CrossOver Games, you can run many popular Windows games on your Intel OS X Mac or Linux PC. Whatever your tastes - first-person shooters, fantasy, strategy, MMORPGs - CrossOver Games provides the capability to run many popular games titles. CrossOver comes with an easy to use, single click interface, which makes installing your games simple and fast. Once installed, your game integrates seamlessly into your Desktop. Just click and run! Best of all, you do it all easily and affordably, without needing a Microsoft operating system license.
</p><p>
CrossOver Games is built on the latest versions of Wine, based on contributions from both CodeWeavers and the open-source Wine community, and then lovingly hand-crafted by Stefan D&#246;singer, our very own Wine/Games connoisseur. Unlike other CrossOver products, which are aimed primarily at office productivity applications (and hence maximum stability), CrossOver Games aims to bring you the latest, greatest, bleeding edge improvements in Wine technology. This means that the newest games run faster and better under CrossOver than under other versions of CrossOver, or other version of free Wine, for that matter. You want to run your Mom's knitting software? Maybe you should look elsewhere. On the other hand, if you need better framerates on Linux or Mac so you can frag your buddies: check out CrossOver Games!

At CodeWeavers, we believe strongly in truth in advertising. This section is an honest appraisal of what CrossOver Games can and cannot do, written after review of our own testing and what our testers have found. Hopefully this will help you to determine whether or not CrossOver is for you.

<topic>Cygwin + Wine</topic>
<p>
The Wine community has a <a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/CygwinSupport">history</a> of trying to get Cygwin to work within Wine.  Cygwin is an emulation layer for POSIX on Win32, and as such is a fairly rigorous test for Wine.  Thus getting Cygwin running is a challenge, but to do so would be a great accomplishment.  Some news from Dan Kegel:

<quote>
<p>
Hey!  Cygwin actually installs and runs inside Wine!
There are a few problems (gcc can't compile
"hello, world" yet, symlinks like the one for vi
don't work yet, the setup utility doesn't
resize properly, and mkpasswd -l aborts), but the shell starts up fine
and vim runs inside it!
</p><p>
Hats off to the Wine team!

<p>
I myself went ahead and tried the same program (fork) from the <a href="http://wiki.winehq.org/CygwinSupport">'CygwinSupport'</a> wiki page and on Wine 0.9.52 got much further than the wiki page but still had some stack errors, and with wine from source (inbetween .58 and .59) also got similar errors.  Well, nobody's perfect, but Wine is certainly making progress!

Dan Kegel, Wine's official "1.0 Release Manager" has begun the squeeze of the 1.0 bug list.  Over the past week or two he has periodically been aggregating numbers and lists of changes recently with respect to the 1.0 goal.  Dan's most recent update:

<topic>Audio</topic>
<p>
Ubuntu's newest release, Hardy Heron, is set to have PulseAudio be the new default sound system.
Fortunately there is an alsa wrapper for PulseAudio that can work with Wine.  However, there are a 
<a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10495">number</a> <a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10910">of</a> <a href="http://bugs.winehq.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10902">problems</a>  with this wrapper and Wine.  
From my poking around it would seem that there is an assumption somewhere within Wine  that the PCM channel exists, and another
bug in the wrapper itself causing issues.  These issues are being worked on.
</p>
<p>
There is also an entire Wine pulseaudio driver being developed outside of the main tree.  <a href="http://www.mail-archive.com/wine-devel@winehq.org/msg35153.html">LINK</a>

</p>

<p>
<a href="http://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2008-February/062849.html">Tomas Carnecky</a> wrote in with an interesting request for information and discussion on Pulse Audio:

</p>

<quote>
<p>
This subject was discussed a few months ago (around 10/2007). But it was
rather a discussion about whether to make a PA sound driver or not. I
personally would love to see that happen, if not only because PA has
some very nifty features, like per-app volume, transparent sink
switching etc, some of which are impossible to emulate through the alsa
pulse plugin. Also, then next Ubuntu and Fedora releases will have PA
enabled by default so if Wine doesn't work with that well there will be
 complaints.
</p>
</quote>
<p>
To which Stefan D&#246;singer replied:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
The point was and is that we don't want yet another half working sound backend
in Wine. We will have to maintain the Alsa one because there are things PA
won't be able to give us by design, like HW mixing and lowest-latency direct
access which is needed for gaming.
</p><p>
Of course, as you said, if someone has patches and intends to maintain it
we're happy to accept it. But I think none of the current Wine sound
developers(aka Maarten) has any intentions to spend time on a PA backend.

</p>
</quote>
<p>For the most part Stefan's opinion is shared amoungst most of the developers which makes a new in-tree PulseAudio driver in the short term unlikely.</p>
<p>
However!  Trevor Davenport has been working on an out-of tree driver for some time.  Status:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
Status currently is that I have basic waveout all cleaned up besides
errors (like if the pulseaudio server isn't running).
 I've also got input and dsound working but it needs cleaned up.
 Hopefully i'll have some time at the end of the week to at least get
a patch submitted to start the discussion.

<p>
Maarten Lankhorst is still working hard at putting together this year's GSoC.  Now that Wine has been accepted and Google is accepting applications from students the letters have been pouring in on the ML and IRC.  Just in case you are still interested and haven't heard all of the details, here is a re-posting of Maarten's meesage to the list:
</p>
<quote>
<p>
Hi all,
</p><p>
Since yesterday google is accepting applications for all participating
projects. See<a href="http://code.google.com/soc">http://code.google.com/soc</a>for how to apply and read the
faq linked there! The past few days a lot of good proposals were
discussed, but you really need to submit them to the google web
application officially to make them count. The deadline for this is 1
april 2008 00:00 UTC, but I would recommend submitting your
application a few days before that to be sure.
</p><p>
It optional, but recommended to slip a patch past Alexandre Julliard,
he's Swiss so bribing with chocolate doesn't work! It doesn't have to
be a big patch, just so that we know you can check out the wine git
tree, and know how to get a patch in. Of course if you already did
this once you don't have to do it again.
</p><p>
A good guideline to what should be in an application is at
http://www.perlfoundation.org/perl5/index.cgi?gsoc2008_proposal_template
You don't have to follow this, but it's a good indication of what an
application should contain. It's also a good idea to separate your
goals into must-haves and nice-to-haves. The must haves you definitely
want to do before the end of the summer, and the nice-to-haves are for
the goals that you want to do, but  you're not sure if you have all
the time for them.
</p><p>
Cheers,
</p><p>
Maarten.
